<h4>A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD</h4>
<p>
Matthew Arnold, poet and critic, was born in the village
of Laleham, Middlesex County, England, December
24, 1822. He was the son of Dr. Thomas Arnold, best
remembered as the great Head Master at Rugby and in
later years distinguished also as a historian of Rome, and
of Mary Penrose Arnold, a woman of remarkable character
and intellect.</p>
<p>
Devoid of stirring incident, and, on the whole, free from
the eccentricities so common to men of genius, the story
of Arnold's life is soon told. As a boy he lived the life
of the normal English lad, with its healthy routine of
task and play. He was at school at both Laleham and
Winchester, then at Rugby, where he attracted attention
as a student and won a prize for poetry. In 1840 he was
elected to an open scholarship at Balliol College, Oxford,
and the next year matriculated for his university work.
Arnold's career at Oxford was a memorable one. While
here he was associated with such men as John Duke
Coleridge, John Shairp, Dean Fraser, Dean Church,
John Henry Newman, Thomas Hughes, the Froudes, and,
closest of all, with Arthur Hugh Clough, whose early<span class="left">[p.x]</span>
death he lamented in his exquisite elegiac poem&mdash;<i>Thyrsis</i>.
Among this brilliant company Arnold moved
with ease, the recognized favorite. Having taken the
Newdigate prize for English verse, and also having won
a scholarship, he was graduated with honors in 1844, and
in March of the following year had the additional distinction
of being elected a Fellow of Oriel, the crowning
glory of an Oxford graduate. He afterward taught classics
for a short time at Rugby, then in 1847 accepted the
post of private secretary to the Marquis of Lansdowne,
Lord President of the Council, which position he occupied
until 1851, when he was appointed Lay Inspector of
Schools by the Committee on Education. The same
year he married Frances Lucy Wightman, daughter of
Sir William Wightman, judge of the Court of the Queen's
Bench.</p>
<p>
Arnold's record as an educator is unparalleled in the
history of England's public schools. For more than
thirty-five years he served as inspector and commissioner,
which offices he filled with efficiency. As inspector he
was earnest, conscientious, versatile; beloved alike by
teachers and pupils. The Dean of Salisbury likened his
appearance to inspect the school at Kiddermaster, to the
admission of a ray of light when a shutter is suddenly
opened in a darkened room. All-in-all, he valued happy-appearing
children, and kindly sympathetic teachers, more
than excellence in grade reports. In connection with the
duties of his office as commissioner, he travelled frequently <span class="left">[p.xi]</span>
on the Continent to inquire into foreign methods
of primary and secondary education. Here he found
much that was worth while, and often carried back to
London larger suggestions and ideas than the national
mind was ready to accept. Under his supervision, however,
the school system of England was extensively revised
and improved. He resigned his position under the
Committee of Council on Education, in 1886, two years
before his death.</p>
<p>
In the meantime Arnold's pen had not been idle. His
first volume of verse, <i>The Strayed Reveller and Other
Poems</i>, appeared (1848), and although quietly received,
slowly won its way into public favor. The next year the
narrative poem, <i>The Sick King in Bokhara</i>, came out, and
was followed in turn by a third volume in 1853, under
the title of <i>Empedocles on Etna and Other Poems</i>. By
this time Arnold's reputation as a poet was established,
and in 1857 he was elected Professor of Poetry at Oxford,
where he began his career as a lecturer, in which
capacity he twice visited America. <i>Merope, a Tragedy</i>
(1856) and a volume under the title of <i>New Poems</i>
(1869) finish the list of his poetical works, with the exception
of occasional verses.</p>
<p>
Arnold's prose works, aside from his letters, consist
wholly of critical essays, in which he has dealt fearlessly
with the greater issues of his day. As will be seen by
their titles (see page xxxviii of this volume), the subject-matter
of these essays is of very great scope, embracing
in theme literature, politics, social conduct, and popular
religion. By them Arnold has exerted a remarkable influence<span class="left">[p.xii]</span>
on public thought and stamped himself as one of the
ablest critics and reformers of the last century. Arnold's
life was thus one of many widely diverse activities and was
at all times deeply concerned with practical as well as with
literary affairs; and on no side was it deficient in human
sympathies and relations. He won respect and reputation
while he lived, and his works continue to attract
men's minds, although with much unevenness. It has
been said of him that, of all the modern poets, except
Goethe, he was the best critic, and of all the modern
critics, with the same exception, he was the best poet.
He died at Liverpool, where he had gone to meet his
daughter returning from America, April 15, 1888. By
his death the world lost an acute and cultured critic, a
refined writer, an earnest educational reformer, and a
noble man. He was buried in his native town, Laleham.</p>
<p>
Agreeably to his own request, Arnold has never been
made the subject for a biography. By means of his letters,
his official reports, and statements of his friends,
however, one is able to trace the successive stages of his
career, as he steadily grew in honor and public usefulness.
Though somewhat inadequate, the picture thus
presented is singularly pleasing and attractive. The
subjoined appreciations have been selected with a view
of giving the student a glimpse of Arnold as he appeared
to unprejudiced minds.</p>
<p>
One who knew him at Oxford wrote of him as follows:
"His perfect self-possession, the sallies of his ready wit,
the humorous turn which he could give to any subject<span class="left">[p.xiii]</span>
that he handled, his gaiety, audacity, and unfailing command
of words, made him one of the most popular and
successful undergraduates that Oxford has ever known."</p>
<p>
"He was beautiful as a young man, strong and manly,
yet full of dreams and schemes. His Olympian manners
began even at Oxford: there was no harm in them: they
were natural, not put on. The very sound of his voice
and wave of his arm were Jove-like."&mdash;PROFESSOR MAX MÜLLER.</p>
<p>
"He was most distinctly on the side of human enjoyment.
He conspired and contrived to make things pleasant.
Pedantry he abhorred. He was a man of this life
and this world. A severe critic of this world he indeed
was; but, finding himself in it, and not precisely knowing
what is beyond it, like a brave and true-hearted man,
he set himself to make the best of it. Its sights and
sounds were dear to him. The 'uncrumpling fern, the
eternal moonlit snow,' the red grouse springing at our
sound, the tinkling bells of the 'high-pasturing kine,'
the vagaries of men, of women, and dogs, their odd ways
and tricks, whether of mind or manner, all delighted,
amused, tickled him."</p><br />

       <hr /><br /><br />
<p>
"In a sense of the word which is noble and blessed,
he was of the earth earthy.... His mind was based on
the plainest possible things. What he hated most was
the fantastic&mdash;the far-fetched, all-elaborated fancies and
strained interpretations. He stuck to the beaten track
of human experience, and the broader the better. He<span class="left">[p.xiv]</span>
was a plain-sailing man. This is his true note."&mdash;MR.
AUGUSTINE BIRRELL.</p>
<p>
"He was incapable of sacrificing the smallest interest
of anybody to his own; he had not a spark of envy or
jealousy; he stood well aloof from all the bustlings and
jostlings by which selfish men push on; he bore life's
disappointments&mdash;and he was disappointed in some
reasonable hopes&mdash;with good nature and fortitude; he
cast no burden upon others, and never shrank from
bearing his own share of the daily load to the last ounce
of it; he took the deepest, sincerest, and most active
interest in the well-being of his country and his countrymen."&mdash;MR.
JOHN MORLEY.</p>
<p>
In his essay on Arnold, George E. Woodberry speaks
of the poet's personality as revealed by his letters in the
following beautiful manner: "Few who did not know
Arnold could have been prepared for the revelation of a
nature so true, so amiable, so dutiful. In every relation
of private life he is shown to have been a man of exceptional
constancy and plainness.... Every one must
take delight in the mental association with Arnold in the
scenes of his existence ... and in his family affections.
A nature warm to its own, kindly to all, cheerful, fond
of sport and fun, and always fed from pure fountains,
and with it a character so founded upon the rock, so
humbly serviceable, so continuing in power and grace,
must wake in all the responses of happy appreciation
and leave the charm of memory.</p>
<p>
"He did his duty as naturally as if it required neither<span class="left">[p.xv]</span>
resolve nor effort, nor thought of any kind for the morrow,
and he never failed, seemingly, in act or word of
sympathy, in little or great things; and when to this one
adds the clear ether of the intellectual life where he
habitually moved in his own life apart, and the humanity
of his home, the gift that these letters bring may
be appreciated. That gift is the man himself, but set in
the atmosphere of home, with sonship and fatherhood,
sisters and brothers, with the bereavements of years fully
accomplished, and those of babyhood and boyhood&mdash;a
sweet and wholesome English home, with all the cloud
and sunshine of the English world drifting over its roof-trees,
and the soil of England beneath its stones, and
English duties for the breath of its being. To add such
a home to the household rights of English Literature is
perhaps something from which Arnold would have shrunk,
but it endears his memory."</p>

<p class="indent">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;"It may be overmuch<br />
He shunned the common stain and smutch,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;From soilure of ignoble touch<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too grandly free,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Too loftily secure in such<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cold purity;<br />
But he preserved from chance control<br />
The fortress of his established soul,<br />
In all things sought to see the whole;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Brooked no disguise,<br />
And set his heart upon the goal,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Not on the prize."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h4>ARNOLD THE <a name="POET">POET</a></h4><span class="left">[p.xvi]</span>
<p>
Matthew Arnold was essentially a man of the intellect.
No other author of modern times, perhaps no other
English author of any time, appeals so directly as he
to the educated classes. Even a cursory reading of his
pages, prose or verse, reveals the scholar and the critic.
He is always thinking, always brilliant, never lacks for
a word or phrase; and on the whole, his judgments are
good. Between his prose and verse, however, there is
a marked difference, both in tone and spiritual quality.
True, each possesses the note of a lofty, though stoical
courage; reveals the same grace of finish and exactness
of phrase and manner; and is, in equal degree, the output
of a singularly sane and noble nature; but here the
comparison ends; for, while his prose is often stormy
and contentious, his poetry has always about it an
atmosphere of entire repose. The cause of this difference
is not far to seek. His poetry, written in early
manhood, reflects his inner self, the more lovable side
of his nature; while his prose presents the critic and
the reformer, pointing out the good and bad, and permitting
at times a spirit of bitterness to creep in, as he
endeavors to arouse men out of their easy contentment
with themselves and their surroundings.</p>
<p>
With the exception of occasional verses, Arnold's
poetical career began and ended inside of twenty years.
The reason for this can only be conjectured, and need
not be dwelt upon here. But although his poetic life<span class="left">[p.xvii]</span>
was brief, it was of a very high order, his poems ranking
well up among the literary productions of the last century.
As a popular poet, however, he will probably never class
with Tennyson or Longfellow. His poems are too coldly
classical and too unattractive in subject to appeal to the
casual reader, who is, generally speaking, inclined toward
poetry of the emotions rather than of the intellect&mdash;Arnold's
usual kind. That he recognized this himself,
witness the following quiet statements made in letters
to his friends: "My poems are making their way, I think,
though slowly, and are perhaps never to make way very
far. There must always be some people, however, to
whom the literalness and sincerity of them has a charm.... They
represent, on the whole, the main movement
of mind of the last quarter of a century, and thus they
will probably have their day, as people become conscious
to themselves of what that movement of mind is,
and interested in the literary productions which reflect
it." Time has verified the accuracy of this judgment.
In short, Arnold has made a profound rather than a
wide impression. To a few, however, of each generation,
he will continue to be a "voice oracular,"&mdash;a poet with
a purpose and a message.</p>
<p>
<b>Arnold's Poetic Culture</b>.&mdash;Obviously, the sources of
Arnold's culture were classical. As one critic has tersely
said, "He turned over his Greek models by day and by
night." Here he found his ideal standards, and here he
brought for comparison all questions that engrossed his
thoughts. Homer (he replied to an inquirer) and<span class="left">[p.xviii]</span>
Epictetus (of mood congenial with his own) were props
of his mind, as were Sophocles, "who saw life steadily
and saw it whole," and Marcus Aurelius, whom he called
the purest of men. These like natures afforded him
repose and consolation. Greek epic and dramatic poetry
and Greek philosophy appealed profoundly to him. Of
the Greek poets he wrote: "No other poets have lived so
much by the imaginative reason; no other poets have
made their works so well balanced; no other poets have
so well satisfied the thinking power; have so well satisfied
the religious sense." More than any other English
poet he prized the qualities of measure, proportion, and
restraint; and to him lucidity, austerity, and high seriousness,
conspicuous elements of classic verse, were the substance
of true poetry. In explaining his own position as
to his art, he says: "In the sincere endeavor to learn
and practise, amid the bewildering confusion of our times,
what is sound and true in poetic art, I seem, to myself to
find the only sure guidance, the only solid footing, among
the ancients. They, at any rate, knew what they wanted
in Art, and we do not. It is this uncertainty which is
disheartening, and not hostile criticism." And again:
"The radical difference between the poetic theory of the
Greeks and our own is this: that with them, the poetical
character of the action in itself, and the conduct of it,
was the first consideration; with us, attention is fixed
mainly on the value of separate thoughts and images
which occur in the treatment of an action. They regard
the whole; we regard the parts. We have poems which<span class="left">[p.xix]</span>
seem to exist merely for the sake of single lines and passages,
and not for the sake of producing any total impression.
We have critics who seem to direct their
attention merely to detached expressions, to the language
about the action, not the action itself. I verily believe
that the majority of them do not believe that there is
such a thing as a total impression to be derived from a
poem at all, or to be demanded from a poet. They will
permit the poet to select any action he pleases, and to
suffer that action to go as it will, provided he gratifies
them with occasional bursts of fine writing, and with
a show of isolated thoughts and images; that is, they
permit him to leave their poetic sense ungratified, provided
that he gratifies their rhetorical sense and their
curiosity."</p>
<p>
Arnold has illustrated, with remarkable success, his
ideas of that unity which gratifies the poetical sense,
and has approached very close to his Greek models in
numerous instances; most notably so in his great epic or
narrative poem, <i>Sohrab and Rustum</i>, which is dealt with
elsewhere in this introduction. Perhaps we could not do
better than to quote for our consideration at this time, a
fine synthesis of Mr. Arthur Galton. He says: "In
Matthew Arnold's style and in his manner, he seems to
me to recall the great masters, and this in a striking and
in an abiding way.... To recall them at all is a rare
gift, but to recall them naturally, and with no strained
sense nor jarring note of imitation, is a gift so exceedingly
rare that it is almost enough in itself to place a<span class="left">[p.xx]</span>
writer among the great masters; to proclaim that he
is one of them. To recall them at all is a rare gift,
though not a unique gift; a few other modern poets
recall them too; but with these, with every one of them,
it is the exception when they resemble the great masters.
They have their own styles, which abide with them; it
is only now and then, by a flash of genius, that they
break through their own styles, and attain the one immortal
style. Just the contrary of this is true of
Matthew Arnold. It is his own, his usual, and his most
natural style which recalls the great masters; and only
when he does not write like himself, does he cease to
resemble them.... No man who attains to this great
style can fail to have a distinguished function; and Matthew
Arnold, like Milton, will be 'a leaven and a power,'
because he, too, has made the great style current in English.
With his desire for culture and for perfection,
there is no destiny he would prefer to this, for which his
nature, his training, and his sympathies, all prepared him.
To convey the message of those ancients whom he loved
so well, in that English tongue which he was taught by
them to use so perfectly;&mdash;to serve as an eternal protest
against charlatanism and vulgarity;&mdash;is exactly the mission
he would have chosen for himself.... The few
writers of our language, therefore, who give us 'an ideal
of excellence, the most high and the most rare,' have an
important function; we should study their works continually,
and it should be a matter of passionate concern with
us, that the 'ideals,' that is, the definite and perfect<span class="left">[p.xxi]</span>
models, should abide with us forever." The Greeks
recognized three kinds of poetry,&mdash;Lyric, Dramatic, and
Epic. Arnold tried all three. First, then, as a lyricist.</p>
<p>
<b>Arnold as a Lyricist</b>.&mdash;Lyric poetry is the artistic expression
of the poet's individual sentiments and emotions,
hence it is subjective. The action is usually vapid, the
verse musical, the time quick. Unlike the Epic and
Drama, it has no preferred verse or meter, but leaves the
poet free to choose or invent appropriate forms. In this
species of verse Arnold was not wholly at ease. As has
been said, one searches in vain through the whole course
of his poetry for a blithe, musical, gay or serious, offhand
poem, the true lyric kind. The reason for this is
soon discovered. Obviously, it lies in the fundamental
qualities of the poet's mind and temperament. Though
by no means lacking in emotional sensibility, Arnold was
too intellectually self-conscious to be carried away by the
impulsiveness common to the lyrical moods. With him
the intellect was always master; the emotions, subordinate.
With the lyricist, the order is, in the main, at
least, reversed. The poet throws off intellectual restraint,
and "lets his illumined being o'errun" with music and
song. This Arnold could not or would not do. Then,
too, Arnold's lyrics are often at fault metrically. This,
combined with frequent questionable rhymes, argues
a not too discriminating poetical ear. He also lacked
genius in inventing verse forms, and hence found himself
under the necessity of employing or adapting those
already in use. In this respect he was notably inferior<span class="left">[p.xxii]</span>
to Tennyson, many of whose measures are wholly
his own. Again, considerable portions of his lyric verse
consist merely of prose, cut into lines of different length,
in imitation of the unrhymed measures of the Greek
poet, Pindar. The Bishop of Derry, commenting on these
rhythmic novelties, likens them to the sound of a stick
drawn by a city gamin sharply across the area railings,&mdash;a
not inapt comparison. That they were not always
successful, witness the following stanza from <i>Merope</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">
"Thou confessest the prize<br />
In the rushing, blundering, mad,<br />
Cloud-enveloped, obscure,<br />
Unapplauded, unsung<br />
Race of Calamity, mine!"
</p>
<p>
Surely this is but the baldest prose. At intervals, however,
Arnold was nobly lyrical, and strangely, too, at
times, in those same uneven measures in which are
found his most signal failures&mdash;the unrhymed Pindaric.
<i>Philomela</i> written in this style is one of the most exquisite
bits of verse in the language. As one critic has put
it, "It ought to be written in silver and bound in gold."
In urbanity of phrase and in depth of genuine pathos it
is unsurpassed and shows Arnold at his best. <i>Rugby
Chapel, The Youth of Nature, The Youth of Man</i>, and
<i>A Dream</i> are good examples of his longer efforts in this
verse form. In the more common lyric measures, Arnold
was, at times, equally successful. Saintsbury, commenting
on <i>Requiescat</i>, says that the poet has "here achieved
the triple union of simplicity, pathos, and (in the best<span class="left">[p.xxiii]</span>
sense) elegance"; and adds that there is not a false note
in the poem. He also speaks enthusiastically of the
"honey-dropping trochees" of the <i>New Sirens</i>, and of
the "chiselled and classic perfection" of the lines of
<i>Resignation</i>. Herbert W. Paul, writing of <i>Mycerinus</i>,
declares that no such verse has been written in England
since Wordsworth's <i>Laodamia</i>; and continues, "The
poem abounds in single lines of haunting charm."
Among his more successful longer lyrics are <i>The Sick
King in Bokhara, Switzerland, Faded Leaves</i>, and <i>Tristram
and Iseult</i>, and <i>Epilogue to Lessing's Laocoön</i>,
included in this volume.</p>
<p>
<b>Arnold as a Dramatist</b>.&mdash;The drama is imitated human
action, and is intended to exhibit a picture of human life
by means of dialogue, acting, and stage accessories. In
nature, it partakes of both lyric and epic, thus uniting
sentiment and action with narration. Characters live
and act before us, and speak in our presence, the interest
being kept up by constantly shifting situations tending
toward some striking result. As a dramatist, Arnold
achieved no great success. Again the fundamental
qualities of his mind stood in the way. An author so
subjective, so absorbed in self-scrutiny and introspection
as he, is seldom able to project himself into the minds of
others to any considerable extent. His dramas are brilliant
with beautiful phrases, his pictures of landscapes
and of nature in her various aspects approach perfection;
but in the main, he fails to handle his plots in a dramatic
manner and, as a result, does not secure the totality of<span class="left">[p.xxiv]</span>
impression so vital to the drama. Frequently, too, his
characters are tedious, and in their dialogue manage to
be provokingly unnatural or insipid. They also lack in
individuality and independence in speech and action.
Many of his situations, likewise, are at fault. For
instance, one can scarcely conceive of such characters
as Ulysses and Circe playing the subordinate roles
assigned to them in <i>The Strayed Reveller</i>. A true
dramatist would hardly have committed so flagrant a
blunder. <i>Merope</i> is written in imitation of the Greek
tragedians. It has dignity of subject, nobility of sentiment,
and a classic brevity of style; but it is frigid and
artificial, and fails in the most essential function of
drama&mdash;to stir the reader's emotions. <i>Empedocles on
Etna</i>, a half-autobiographical drama, is in some respects
a striking poem. It is replete with brilliant passages,
and contains some of Arnold's best lyric verses and most
beautiful nature pictures; but the dialogue is colorless,
the rhymes poor, the plot, such as it contains, but indifferently
handled, and even Empedocles, the principal
character, is frequently tedious and unnatural. Arnold's
dramas show that his forte was not in character-drawing
nor in dialogue.</p>
<p>
<b>Arnold as a Writer of Epic and Elegy</b>.&mdash;Epic poetry narrates
in grand style the achievements of heroes&mdash;the
poet telling the story as if present. It is simple in construction
and uniform in meter, yet it admits of the dialogue
and the episode, and though not enforcing a moral
it may hold one in solution. Elegiac poetry is plaintive<span class="left">[p.xxv]</span>
in tone and expresses sorrow or lamentation. Both epic
and elegy are inevitably serious in mood, and slow and
stately in action. In these two forms of verse Arnold
was at his best. Stockton pronounced <i>Sohrab and
Rustum</i> the noblest poem in the English language.
Another critic has said that "it is the nearest analogue
in English to the rapidity of action, plainness of thought,
plainness of diction, and nobleness of Homer." Combining,
as it does, classic purity of style with romantic ardor
of feeling, it stands a direct exemplification of Arnold's
poetic theories, as set forth in the preface of his volume
of 1853. Especially is it successful in emphasizing his
idea of unity of impression; "while the truth of its
oriental color, the deep pathos of the situation, the fire
and intensity of the action, the strong conception of
character, and the full, solemn music of the verse, make
it unquestionably the masterpiece of Arnold's longer
poems, among which it is the largest in bulk and also
the most ambitious in scheme." <i>Balder Dead</i>, a characteristic
Arnoldian production, founded upon the Norse
legend of Balder, Lok, and Hader, though not so great
as <i>Sohrab and Rustum</i>, has much poetic worth and ranks
high among its kind; and <i>Tristram and Iseult</i>, with its
infinite tragedy, and <i>The Sick King in Bokhara</i>, gorgeous
in oriental color, are rare examples of the lyrical epic.
<i>The Forsaken Merman</i> and <i>Saint Brandan</i>, which are
dealt with elsewhere in this volume, are good examples
of his shorter narrative poems. In <i>Thyrsis</i>, the beautiful
threnody in which he celebrated his dead friend, Clough,<span class="left">[p.xxvi]</span>
Arnold gave to the world one of its greatest elegies. One
finds in this poem and its companion piece, <i>The Scholar-Gipsy</i>,
the same unity of classic form with romantic feeling
present in <i>Sohrab and Rustum</i>. Both are crystal-clear
without coldness, and restrained without loss of a full
volume of power. Mr. Saintsbury, writing of <i>The Scholar-Gipsy</i>,
says: "It has everything&mdash;a sufficient scheme, a
definite meaning and purpose, a sustained and adequate
command of poetical presentation, and passages and
phrases of the most exquisite beauty;" and no less
praise is due <i>Thyrsis</i>. Other of his elegiac poems
are <i>Heine's Grave, Stanzas from the Grande Chartreuse,
Stanzas in Memory of the Author of "Obermann," Obermann
Once More, Rugby Chapel</i>, and <i>Memorial Verses</i>, the
two last named being included in this volume. In such
measures as are used in these poems, in the long, stately,
swelling measures, whose graver movements accord with a
serious and elevated purpose, Arnold was most at ease.</p>
<p>
<b>Greek Spirit in Arnold</b>.&mdash;But it is not alone in the fact
that he selects classic subjects, and writes after the manner
of the great masters, that Arnold's affinity with the
Greeks is manifested. His poems in spirit, as in form,
reflect the moods common to the ancient Hellenes, "One
feels the (Greek) quality," writes George E. Woodberry,
"not as a source, but as a presence. In Tennyson, Keats,
and Shelley there was Greek influence, but in them the
result was modern. In Arnold the antiquity remains&mdash;remains
in mood, just as in Landor it remains in form.
The Greek twilight broods over all his poetry. It is<span class="left">[p.xxvii]</span>
pagan in philosophic spirit, not Attic, but of later and
stoical time; with the patience, endurance, suffering, not
in the Christian types, but as they now seem to a post-Christian
imagination, looking back to the past." Even
when his poems treat of modern or romantic subjects, one
is impressed with the feeling that he presents them with
the same quality of imagination as would the Greek
masters themselves: and in the same form.</p>
<p>
<b>Arnold's Attitude toward Nature</b>.&mdash;In his attitude toward
Nature Arnold is often compared to Wordsworth. A
close study, however, reveals a wide difference, both in
the way Nature appealed to them and in their mood in
her presence. To Arnold she offered a temporary refuge
from the doubts and distractions of our modern life,&mdash;a
soothing, consoling, uplifting power; to Wordsworth she
was an inspiration,&mdash;a presence that disturbed him "with
the joy of elevated thoughts." Conscious of the help he
found in her association, Arnold urged all men to follow
Nature's example; to possess their souls in quietude, despite
the storm and turmoil without. Pancoast says:
"He delights in leading us to contemplate the infinite
calm of Nature, beside which man's transitory woes are
reduced to a mere fretful insignificance. All the beautiful
poem of <i>Tristram and Iseult</i> is built upon the skilful
alternation of two themes. We pass from the feverish,
wasting, and ephemeral struggle of human passions and
desire, into an atmosphere that shames its heat and fume
by an immemorial coolness and repose;" and the same
comparison constitutes the theme for a considerable portion<span class="left">[p.xxviii]</span>
of his poetical work. In his method of approaching
Nature, Arnold also differed widely from Wordsworth, in
that he saw with the outward eye, that is objectively;
while Wordsworth saw rather with the inward eye, or
subjectively. In this Arnold is essentially Greek and
more Tennysonian than Wordsworthian. Many of his
poems, in full or in part, are mere nature pictures, and
are artistic in the extreme. The pictures of the Oxus
stream at the close of <i>Sohrab and Rustum</i>; the English
garden in <i>Thyrsis</i>; and the hunter on the arras, in <i>Tristram
and Iseult</i>, are all notable examples. This pictorial
method Wordsworth seldom used. In spirit, too, the
poets differed widely. To Wordsworth, Nature was, first
of all, the abiding place of God; but Arnold "finds in
the wood and field no streaming forth of beauty and wisdom
from the fountainhead of beauty," no habitancy of
Nature's God.</p>
<p>
<b>Arnold's Attitude toward Life</b>.&mdash;Arnold's attitude toward
life has been dwelt upon in the appreciations under the
biographical sketch in this volume and need only briefly
be summed up here. To him, human life in its higher
developments presented itself as a stern and strenuous
affair; but he never faltered nor sought to escape from
his share of the burden. "On the contrary, the prevailing
note of his poetry is self-reliance; help must come from
the soul itself, for</p>

<p class="indent">
"The fountains of life are all within."
</p>
<p>
He preaches fortitude and courage in the face of the<span class="left">[p.xxix]</span>
mysterious and the inevitable&mdash;a courage, indeed, forlorn
and pathetic in the eyes of many&mdash;and he constantly
takes refuge from the choking cares of life, in a
kind of stoical resignation. As a reformer, his function
was especially to stir people up, to make them dissatisfied
with themselves and their institutions, and to force them
to think, to become individual. Everywhere in his
works one is confronted by his unvarying insistence
upon the supremacy of conduct and duty. The modern
tendency to drift away from the old, established religious
faith was a matter of serious thought to him and led him
to give to the world a rational creed that would satisfy
the sceptics and attract the indifferent. We cannot do
better than quote for our closing thought the following
pregnant lines from the author's sonnet entitled <i>The
Better Part</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">
"Hath man no second life? <i>Pitch this one high!</i><br />
Sits there no judge in Heaven, our sin to see?<br />
<i>More strictly, then, the inward judge obey</i>!<br />
Was Christ a man like us? <i>Ah! let us try<br />
If we then, too, can be such men as he!</i>"
</p>

      <br /><hr/><br /><br />



<h4>ARNOLD THE <a name="CRITIC">CRITIC</a></h4>
<p>
The following extracts on Arnold as a critic are quoted
from well-known authorities.</p>
<p>
"Arnold's prose has little trace of the wistful melancholy
of his verse. It is almost always urbane, vivacious,
light-hearted. The classical bent of his mind<span class="left">[p.xxx]</span>
shows itself here, unmixed with the inheritance of romantic
feeling which colors his poetry. Not only is his
prose classical in quality, by virtue of its restraint, of
its definite aim, and of the dry white light of intellect
which suffuses it; but the doctrine which he spent his
life in preaching is based upon a classical ideal, the ideal
of symmetry, wholeness, or, as he daringly called it, <i>perfection</i>.... Wherever,
in religion, politics, education,
or literature, he saw his countrymen under the domination
of narrow ideals, he came speaking the mystic word
of deliverance, 'Culture.' Culture, acquaintance with
the best which has been thought and done in the world,
is his panacea for all ills.... In almost all of his
prose writing he attacks some form of 'Philistinism,'
by which word he characterized the narrow-mindedness
and self-satisfaction of the British middle class.</p>
<p>
"Arnold's tone is admirably fitted to the peculiar task
he had to perform.... In <i>Culture and Anarchy</i> and
many successive works, he made his plea for the gospel
of ideas with urbanity and playful grace, as befitted the
Hellenic spirit, bringing 'sweetness and light' into the
dark places of British prejudice. Sometimes, as in <i>Literature
and Dogma</i>, where he pleads for a more liberal
and literary reading of the Bible, his manner is quiet,
suave, and gently persuasive. At other times, as in
<i>Friendship's Garland</i>, he shoots the arrows of his sarcasm
into the ranks of the Philistines with a delicate
raillery and scorn, all the more exasperating to his foes,
because it is veiled by a mock humility, and is scrupulously<span class="left">[p.xxxi]</span>
polite.</p>
<p>
"Of Arnold's literary criticism, the most notable single
piece is the famous essay <i>On Translating Homer</i>, which
deserves careful study for the enlightenment it offers concerning
many of the fundamental questions of style. The
essays on Wordsworth and on Byron from <i>Essays in Criticism</i>,
and that on Emerson, from <i>Discourses in America</i>,
furnish good examples of Arnold's charm of manner and
weight of matter in this province.</p>
<p>
"The total impression which Arnold makes in his prose
may be described as that of a spiritual man-of-the-world.
In comparison with Carlyle, Buskin, and Newman, he is
worldly. For the romantic passion and mystic vision of
these men he substitutes an ideal of balanced cultivation,
the ideal of the trained, sympathetic, cosmopolitan gentleman.
He marks a return to the conventions of life after
the storm and stress of the romantic age. Yet in his
own way he also was a prophet and a preacher, striving
whole-heartedly to release his countrymen from bondage
to mean things, and pointing their gaze to that symmetry
and balance of character which has seemed to many noble
minds the true goal of human endeavor."&mdash;MOODY AND
LOVETT, <i>A History of English Literature</i>.</p>
<p>
"As a literary critic, his taste, his temper, his judgment
were pretty nearly infallible. He combined a loyal
and reasonable submission to literary authority, with a
free and even daring use of private judgment. His admiration
for the acknowledged masters of human utterance&mdash;Homer,
Sophocles, Shakespeare, Milton, Goethe&mdash;<span class="left">[p.xxxii]</span>was genuine and enthusiastic,
and incomparably better
informed than that of some more conventional critics.
Yet this cordial submission to recognized authority, this
honest loyalty to established reputation, did not blind
him to defects; did not seduce him into indiscriminating
praise; did not deter him from exposing the tendency to
verbiage in Burke and Jeremy Taylor, the excess blankness
of much of Wordsworth's blank verse, the undercurrent
of mediocrity in Macaulay, the absurdities of
Mr. Ruskin's etymology. And as in great matters, so in
small. Whatever literary production was brought under
Matthew Arnold's notice, his judgment was clear, sympathetic,
and independent. He had the readiest appreciation
of true excellence, a quick intolerance of turgidity
and inflation&mdash;of what he called endeavors to render
platitude endurable by making it pompous, and lively
horror of affectation and unreality."&mdash;Mr. GEORGE RUSSELL.</p>
<p>
"In his work as literary critic Arnold has occupied a
high place among the foremost prose writers of the time.
His style is in marked contrast to the dithyrambic eloquence
of Carlyle, or to Ruskin's pure and radiant coloring.
It is a quiet style, restrained, clear, discriminating,
incisive, with little glow of ardor or passion. Notwithstanding
its scrupulous assumption of urbanity, it is
often a merciless style, indescribably irritating to an
opponent by its undercurrent of sarcastic humor, and
its calm air of assured superiority. By his insistence
on a high standard of technical excellence, and by his<span class="left">[p.xxxiii]</span>
admirable presentation of certain principles of literary
judgment, Arnold performed a great work for literature.
On the other hand, we miss here, as in his poetry, the
human element, the comprehensive sympathy that we
recognize in the criticism of Carlyle. Yet Carlyle could
not have written the essay <i>On Translating Homer</i>, with
all its scholarly discrimination in style and technique,
any more than Arnold could have produced Carlyle's
large-hearted essay on <i>Burns</i>. Arnold's varied energy
and highly trained intelligence have been felt in many
different fields. He has won a peculiar and honorable
place in the poetry of the century; he has excelled as
literary critic, he has labored in the cause of education,
and finally, in his <i>Culture and Anarchy</i>, he has set forth
his scheme of social reform, and in certain later books
has made His contribution to contemporary thought."&mdash;PANCOAST, <i>Introduction to English Literature</i>.</p>

<p class="indent4">
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;°<a href="#1">1</a></span>And the first grey of morning fill'd the east,°<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;°<a href="#2">2</a></span>And the fog rose out of the Oxus° stream.	<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;°<a href="#3">3</a></span>But all the Tartar camp° along the stream	<br />
Was hush'd, and still the men were plunged in sleep;<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5</span>Sohrab alone, he slept not; all night long<br />
He had lain wakeful, tossing on his bed;<br />
But when the grey dawn stole into his tent,<br />
He rose, and clad himself, and girt his sword,<br />
And took his horseman's cloak, and left his tent,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;10</span>And went abroad into the cold wet fog,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#11">11</a></span>Through the dim camp to Peran-Wisa's° tent.<br /><br />
Through the black Tartar tents he pass'd, which stood<br />
Clustering like bee-hives on the low flat strand<br />
Of Oxus, where the summer-floods o'erflow<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#15">15</a></span>When the sun melts the snows in high Pamere°	<br />
Through the black tents he pass'd, o'er that low strand,<br />
And to a hillock came, a little back<br />
From the stream's brink&mdash;the spot where first a boat,<br />
Crossing the stream in summer, scrapes the land.<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;20</span>The men of former times had crown'd the top<br />
With a clay fort; but that was fall'n, and now<br /><span class="left">[p.2]</span>
The Tartars built there Peran-Wisa's tent,<br />
A dome of laths, and o'er it felts were spread.<br />
And Sohrab came there, and went in, and stood<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;25</span>Upon the thick piled carpets in the tent,<br />
And found the old man sleeping on his bed<br />
Of rugs and felts, and near him lay his arms.<br />
And Peran-Wisa heard him, though the step<br />
Was dull'd; for he slept light, an old man's sleep;<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;30</span>And he rose quickly on one arm, and said:&mdash;<br /><br />
"Who art thou? for it is not yet clear dawn.<br />
Speak! is there news, or any night alarm?"<br /><br />
But Sohrab came to the bedside, and said:&mdash;<br />
"Thou know'st me, Peran-Wisa! it is I.<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;35</span>The sun is not yet risen, and the foe<br />
Sleep; but I sleep not; all night long I lie<br />
Tossing and wakeful, and I come to thee.<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#38">38</a></span>For so did King Afrasiab° bid me seek<br />
Thy counsel, and to heed thee as thy son,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#40">40</a></span>In Samarcand,° before the army march'd;<br />
And I will tell thee what my heart desires.<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#42">42</a></span>Thou know'st if, since from Ader-baijan° first	<br />
I came among the Tartars and bore arms,<br />
I have still served Afrasiab well, and shown,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#45">45</a></span>At my boy's years,° the courage of a man.<br />
This too thou know'st, that while I still bear on<br />
The conquering Tartar ensigns through the world,<br />
And beat the Persians back on every field,<br />
I seek one man, one man, and one alone&mdash;<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;50</span>Rustum, my father; who I hoped should greet,<br />
Should one day greet, upon some well-fought field,<br />
His not unworthy, not inglorious son.<br />
So I long hoped, but him I never find.<br />
Come then, hear now, and grant me what I ask.<br /><span class="left">[p.3]</span>
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;55</span>Let the two armies rest to-day; but I<br />
Will challenge forth the bravest Persian lords<br />
To meet me, man to man; if I prevail,<br />
Rustum will surely hear it; if I fall&mdash;<br />
Old man, the dead need no one, claim no kin.<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#60">60</a></span>Dim is the rumour of a common fight,°<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#61">61</a></span>Where host meets host, and many names are sunk°;<br />
But of a single combat fame speaks clear."<br /><br />
He spoke; and Peran-Wisa took the hand<br />
Of the young man in his, and sigh'd, and said:&mdash;<br /><br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;65</span>"O Sohrab, an unquiet heart is thine!<br />
Canst thou not rest among the Tartar chiefs,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#67">67</a></span>And share the battle's common chance° with us<br />
Who love thee, but must press for ever first,<br />
In single fight incurring single risk,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#70">70</a></span>To find a father thou hast never seen°?<br />
That were far best, my son, to stay with us<br />
Unmurmuring; in our tents, while it is war,<br />
And when 'tis truce, then in Afrasiab's towns.<br />
But, if this one desire indeed rules all,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;75</span>To seek out Rustum&mdash;seek him not through fight!<br />
Seek him in peace, and carry to his arms,<br />
O Sohrab, carry an unwounded son!<br />
But far hence seek him, for he is not here.<br />
For now it is not as when I was young,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;80</span>When Rustum was in front of every fray;<br />
But now he keeps apart, and sits at home,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#82">82</a></span>In Seistan,° with Zal, his father old.<br />
Whether that his own mighty strength at last<br />
Feels the abhorr'd approaches of old age,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#85">85</a></span>Or in some quarrel° with the Persian King.°<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#86">86</a></span>There go°!&mdash;Thou wilt not? Yet my heart forebodes	<br />
Danger or death awaits thee on this field.<br /><span class="left">[p.4]</span>
Fain would I know thee safe and well, though lost<br />
To us; fain therefore send thee hence, in peace<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;90</span>To seek thy father, not seek single fights<br />
In vain;&mdash;but who can keep the lion's cub<br />
From ravening, and who govern Rustum's son?<br />
Go, I will grant thee what thy heart desires."<br /><br />
So said he, and dropp'd Sohrab's hand, and left<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;95</span>His bed, and the warm rugs whereon he lay;<br />
And o'er his chilly limbs his woollen coat<br />
He pass'd, and tied his sandals on his feet,<br />
And threw a white cloak round him, and he took<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#99">99</a></span>In his right hand a ruler's staff, no sword°;<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;100</span>And on his head he set his sheep-skin cap,<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#101">101</a></span>Black, glossy, curl'd, the fleece of Kara-Kul°;	<br />
And raised the curtain of his tent, and call'd<br />
His herald to his side, and went abroad.<br /><br />
The sun by this had risen, and clear'd the fog<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;105</span>From the broad Oxus and the glittering sands.<br />
And from their tents the Tartar horsemen filed<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#107">107</a></span>Into the open plain; so Haman° bade&mdash;<br />
Haman, who next to Peran-Wisa ruled<br />
The host, and still was in his lusty prime.<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;110</span>From their black tents, long files of horse, they stream'd;<br />
As when some grey November morn the files,<br />
In marching order spread, of long-neck'd cranes<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#113">113</a></span>Stream over Casbin° and the southern slopes	<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#114">114</a></span>Of Elburz,° from the Aralian estuaries,	<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#115">115</a></span>Or some frore° Caspian reed-bed, southward bound<br />
For the warm Persian sea-board&mdash;so they stream'd.<br />
The Tartars of the Oxus, the King's guard,<br />
First, with black sheep-skin caps and with long spears;<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#119">119</a></span>Large men, large steeds; who from Bokhara° come	<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#120">120</a></span>And Khiva,° and ferment the milk of mares.°<br /><span class="left">[p.5]</span>
<span class="right">°<a href="#121">121</a></span>Next, the more temperate Toorkmuns° of the south,<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#122">122</a></span>The Tukas,° and the lances of Salore,<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#123">123</a></span>And those from Attruck° and the Caspian sands;<br />
Light men and on light steeds, who only drink<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;125</span>The acrid milk of camels, and their wells.<br />
And then a swarm of wandering horse, who came<br />
From far, and a more doubtful service own'd;<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#128">128</a></span>The Tartars of Ferghana,° from the banks<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#129">129</a></span>Of the Jaxartes,° men with scanty beards	<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;130</span>And close-set skull-caps; and those wilder hordes<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#131">131</a></span>Who roam o'er Kipchak° and the northern waste,<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#132">132</a></span>Kalmucks° and unkempt Kuzzaks,° tribes who stray	<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#133">133</a></span>Nearest the Pole, and wandering Kirghizzes,°	<br />
Who come on shaggy ponies from Pamere;<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;135</span>These all filed out from camp into the plain.<br />
And on the other side the Persians form'd;&mdash;<br />
First a light cloud of horse, Tartars they seem'd.<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#138">138</a></span>The Ilyats of Khorassan°; and behind,	<br />
The royal troops of Persia, horse and foot,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;140</span>Marshall'd battalions bright in burnish'd steel.<br />
But Peran-Wisa with his herald came,<br />
Threading the Tartar squadrons to the front,<br />
And with his staff kept back the foremost ranks.<br />
And when Ferood, who led the Persians, saw<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;145</span>That Peran-Wisa kept the Tartars back,<br />
He took his spear, and to the front he came,<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#147">147</a></span>And check'd his ranks, and fix'd° them where they stood.	<br />
And the old Tartar came upon the sand<br />
Betwixt the silent hosts, and spake, and said:&mdash;<br /><br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;150</span>"Ferood, and ye, Persians and Tartars, hear!<br />
Let there be truce between the hosts to-day.<br />
But choose a champion from the Persian lords<br />
To fight our champion Sohrab, man to man."<br /><br /><span class="left">[p.6]</span>
As, in the country, on a morn in June,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;155</span>When the dew glistens on the pearled ears,<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#156">156</a></span>A shiver runs through the deep corn° for joy&mdash;<br />
So, when they heard what Peran-Wisa said,<br />
A thrill through all the Tartar squadrons ran<br />
Of pride and hope for Sohrab, whom they loved.<br /><br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#160">160</a></span>But as a troop of pedlars, from Cabool,°	<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#161">161</a></span>Cross underneath the Indian Caucasus,°<br />
That vast sky-neighbouring mountain of milk snow;<br />
Crossing so high, that, as they mount, they pass<br />
Long flocks of travelling birds dead on the snow,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;165</span>Choked by the air, and scarce can they themselves<br />
Slake their parch'd throats with sugar'd mulberries&mdash;<br />
In single file they move, and stop their breath,<br />
For fear they should dislodge the o'erhanging snows&mdash;<br />
So the pale Persians held their breath with fear.<br /><br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;170</span>And to Ferood his brother chiefs came up	<br />
To counsel; Gudurz and Zoarrah came,<br />
And Feraburz, who ruled the Persian host<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#173">173</a></span>Second, and was the uncle of the King°;	<br />
These came and counsell'd, and then Gudurz said:&mdash;<br /><br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;175</span>"Ferood, shame bids us take their challenge up,	<br />
Yet champion have we none to match this youth.<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#177">177</a></span>He has the wild stag's foot, the lion's heart.°	<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#178">178</a></span>But Rustum came last night; aloof he sits°	<br />
And sullen, and has pitch'd his tents apart.<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;180</span>Him will I seek, and carry to his ear<br />
The Tartar challenge, and this young man's name.<br />
Haply he will forget his wrath, and fight.<br />
Stand forth the while, and take their challenge up."<br /><br />
So spake he; and Ferood stood forth and cried:&mdash;<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;185</span>"Old man, be it agreed as thou hast said!<br />
Let Sohrab arm, and we will find a man."<br /><span class="left">[p.7]</span>
He spake: and Peran-Wisa turn'd, and strode<br />
Back through the opening squadrons to his tent.<br />
But through the anxious Persians Gudurz ran,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;190</span>And cross'd the camp which lay behind, and reach'd,<br />
Out on the sands beyond it, Rustum's tents.<br />
Of scarlet cloth they were, and glittering gay,<br />
Just pitch'd; the high pavilion in the midst<br />
Was Rustum's, and his men lay camp'd around.<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;195</span>And Gudurz enter'd Rustum's tent, and found<br />
Rustum; his morning meal was done, but still<br />
The table stood before him, charged with food&mdash;<br />
A side of roasted sheep, and cakes of bread;<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#199">199</a></span>And dark green melons; and there Rustum sate°	<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#200">200</a></span>Listless, and held a falcon° on his wrist,<br />
And play'd with it; but Gudurz came and stood<br />
Before him; and he look'd, and saw him stand,<br />
And with a cry sprang up and dropp'd the bird,<br />
And greeted Gudurz with both hands, and said:&mdash;<br /><br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;205</span>"Welcome! these eyes could see no better sight.<br />
What news? but sit down first, and eat and drink."<br /><br />
But Gudurz stood in the tent-door, and said:&mdash;<br />
"Not now! a time will come to eat and drink,<br />
But not to-day; to-day has other needs.<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;210</span>The armies are drawn out, and stand at gaze;<br />
For from the Tartars is a challenge brought<br />
To pick a champion from the Persian lords<br />
To fight their champion&mdash;and thou know'st his name&mdash;<br />
Sohrab men call him, but his birth is hid.<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;215</span>O Rustum, like thy might is this young man's!<br />
He has the wild stag's foot, the lion's heart;<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#217">217</a></span>And he is young, and Iran's° chiefs are old,<br />
Or else too weak; and all eyes turn to thee.<br />
Come down and help us, Rustum, or we lose!"<br /><br />
<span class="left">[p.8]</span>

<span class="right">&nbsp;220</span>He spoke; but Rustum answer'd with a smile:&mdash;<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#221">221</a></span>"Go to°! if Iran's chiefs are old, then I	<br />
Am older; if the young are weak, the King<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#223">223</a></span>Errs strangely; for the King, for Kai Khosroo,°<br />
Himself is young, and honours younger men,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;225</span>And lets the aged moulder to their graves.<br />
Rustum he loves no more, but loves the young&mdash;<br />
The young may rise at Sohrab's vaunts, not I.<br />
For what care I, though all speak Sohrab's fame?<br />
For would that I myself had such a son,<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#230">230</a></span>And not that one slight helpless girl° I have&mdash;<br />
A son so famed, so brave, to send to war,<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#232">232</a></span>And I to tarry with the snow-hair'd Zal,°<br />
My father, whom the robber Afghans vex,<br />
And clip his borders short, and drive his herds,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;235</span>And he has none to guard his weak old age.<br />
There would I go, and hang my armour up,<br />
And with my great name fence that weak old man,<br />
And spend the goodly treasures I have got,<br />
And rest my age, and hear of Sohrab's fame,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;240</span>And leave to death the hosts of thankless kings,<br />
And with these slaughterous hands draw sword no more."<br /><br />

He spoke, and smiled; and Gudurz made reply:&mdash;<br />
"What then, O Rustum, will men say to this,<br />
When Sohrab dares our bravest forth, and seeks<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;245</span>Thee most of all, and thou, whom most he seeks,<br />
Hidest thy face? Take heed lest men should say:<br />
<i class="indent4">Like some old miser, Rustum hoards his fame,</i><br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#248">248</a></span><i class="indent4">And shuns to peril it with younger men."</i>°	<br /><br />

And, greatly moved, then Rustum made reply:&mdash;<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;250</span>"O Gudurz, wherefore dost thou say such words?<br />
Thou knowest better words than this to say.<br />
What is one more, one less, obscure or famed,<br />
Valiant or craven, young or old, to me?<br /><span class="left">[p.9]</span>
Are not they mortal, am not I myself?<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;255</span>But who for men of nought would do great deeds?<br />
Come, thou shalt see how Rustum hoards his fame!<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#257">257</a></span>But I will fight unknown, and in plain arms°;	<br />
Let not men say of Rustum, he was match'd<br />
In single fight with any mortal man."<br /><br />

<span class="right">&nbsp;260</span>He spoke, and frown'd; and Gudurz turn'd, and ran<br />
Back quickly through the camp in fear and joy&mdash;<br />
Fear at his wrath, but joy that Rustum came.<br />
But Rustum strode to his tent-door, and call'd<br />
His followers in, and bade them bring his arms,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;265</span>And clad himself in steel; the arms he chose<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#266">266</a></span>Were plain, and on his shield was no device,°<br />
Only his helm was rich, inlaid with gold,<br />
And, from the fluted spine atop, a plume<br />
Of horsehair waved, a scarlet horsehair plume.<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;270</span>So arm'd, he issued forth; and Ruksh, his horse,<br />
Follow'd him like a faithful hound at heel&mdash;<br />
Ruksh, whose renown was noised through all the earth,<br />
The horse, whom Rustum on a foray once<br />
Did in Bokhara by the river find<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;275</span>A colt beneath its dam, and drove him home,<br />
And rear'd him; a bright bay, with lofty crest,<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#277">277</a></span><a name="Dight">Dight</a>° with a saddle-cloth of broider'd green<br />
Crusted with gold, and on the ground were work'd<br />
All beasts of chase, all beasts which hunters know.<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;280</span>So follow'd, Rustum left his tents, and cross'd<br />
The camp, and to the Persian host appear'd.<br />
And all the Persians knew him, and with shouts<br />
Hail'd; but the Tartars knew not who he was.<br />
And dear as the wet diver to the eyes<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;285</span>Of his pale wife who waits and weeps on shore,<br /><span class="left">[p.10]</span>
<span class="right">°<a href="#286">286</a></span>By sandy Bahrein,° in the Persian Gulf,<br />
Plunging all day in the blue waves, at night,<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#288">288</a></span>Having made up his tale° of precious pearls,<br />
Rejoins her in their hut upon the sands&mdash;<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;290</span>So dear to the pale Persians Rustum came.<br /><br />

And Rustum to the Persian front advanced,<br />
And Sohrab arm'd in Haman's tent, and came.<br />
And as afield the reapers cut a swath<br />
Down through the middle of a rich man's corn,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;295</span>And on each side are squares of standing corn,<br />
And in the midst a stubble, short and bare&mdash;<br />
So on each side were squares of men, with spears<br />
Bristling, and in the midst, the open sand.<br />
And Rustum came upon the sand, and cast<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;300</span>His eyes toward the Tartar tents, and saw<br />
Sohrab come forth, and eyed him as he came.<br /><br />

As some rich woman, on a winter's morn,<br />
Eyes through her silken curtains the poor drudge<br />
Who with numb blacken'd fingers makes her fire&mdash;<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;305</span>At cock-crow, on a starlit winter's morn,<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#306">306</a></span>When the frost flowers° the whiten'd window-panes&mdash;<br />
And wonders how she lives, and what the thoughts<br />
Of that poor drudge may be; so Rustum eyed<br />
The unknown adventurous youth, who from afar<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;310</span>Came seeking Rustum, and defying forth<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#311">311</a></span>All the most valiant chiefs; long he perused°	<br />
His spirited air, and wonder'd who he was.<br />
For very young he seem'd, tenderly rear'd;<br />
Like some young cypress, tall, and dark, and straight,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;315</span>Which in a queen's secluded garden throws<br />
Its slight dark shadow on the moonlit turf,<br />
By midnight, to a bubbling fountain's sound&mdash;<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#318">318</a></span>So slender Sohrab seem'd,° so softly rear'd.<br /><span class="left">[p.11]</span>
And a deep pity enter'd Rustum's soul<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;320</span>As he beheld him coming; and he stood,<br />
And beckon'd to him with his hand, and said:&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;"O thou young man, the air of Heaven is soft,<br />
And warm, and pleasant; but the grave is cold!<br />
Heaven's air is better than the cold dead grave.<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#325">325</a></span>Behold me! I am vast,° and clad in iron,<br />
And tried°; and I have stood on many a field<br />
Of blood, and I have fought with many a foe&mdash;<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#328">328</a></span>Never was that field lost, or that foe saved.°<br />
O Sohrab, wherefore wilt thou rush on death?<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#330">330</a></span>Be govern'd°! quit the Tartar host, and come<br />
To Iran, and be as my son to me,<br />
And fight beneath my banner till I die!<br />
There are no youths in Iran brave as thou."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;So he spake, mildly; Sohrab heard his voice,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;335</span>The mighty voice of Rustum, and he saw<br />
His giant figure planted on the sand,<br />
Sole, like some single tower, which a chief<br />
Hath builded on the waste in former years<br />
Against the robbers; and he saw that head,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;340</span>Streak'd with its first grey hairs;&mdash;hope filled his soul,<br />
And he ran forward and embraced his knees,<br />
And clasp'd his hand within his own, and said:&mdash;<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#343">343</a></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;"O, by thy father's head°! by thine own soul<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#344">344</a></span>Art thou not Rustum°? speak! art thou not he?"<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;345</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;But Rustum eyed askance the kneeling youth,<br />
And turn'd away, and spake to his own soul:&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah me, I muse what this young fox may mean!<br />
False, wily, boastful, are these Tartar boys.<br />
For if I now confess this thing he asks,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;350</span>And hide it not, but say: <i class="indent4">Rustum is here</i>!<br />
He will not yield indeed, nor quit our foes,<br /><span class="left">[p.12]</span>
But he will find some pretext not to fight,<br />
And praise my fame, and proffer courteous gifts<br />
A belt or sword perhaps, and go his way.<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;355</span>And on a feast-tide, in Afrasiab's hall,<br />
In Samarcand, he will arise and cry:<br />
'I challenged once, when the two armies camp'd<br />
Beside the Oxus, all the Persian lords<br />
To cope with me in single fight; but they<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;360</span>Shrank, only Rustum dared; then he and I<br />
Changed gifts, and went on equal terms away.'<br />
So will he speak, perhaps, while men applaud;<br />
Then were the chiefs of Iran shamed through me."<br /><br />

And then he turn'd, and sternly spake aloud:&mdash;<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;365</span>"Rise! wherefore dost thou vainly question thus<br />
Of Rustum? I am here, whom thou hast call'd<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#367">367</a></span>By challenge forth; make good thy vaunt,° or yield!	<br />
Is it with Rustum only thou wouldst fight?<br />
Rash boy, men look on Rustum's face and flee!<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;370</span>For well I know, that did great Rustum stand<br />
Before thy face this day, and were reveal'd,<br />
There would be then no talk of fighting more.<br />
But being what I am, I tell thee this&mdash;<br />
Do thou record it in thine inmost soul:<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;375</span>Either thou shalt renounce thy vaunt and yield,<br />
Or else thy bones shall strew this sand, till winds<br />
Bleach them, or Oxus with his summer-floods,<br />
Oxus in summer wash them all away."<br /><br />

He spoke; and Sohrab answer'd, on his feet:&mdash;<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#380">380</a></span>"Art thou so fierce? Thou wilt not fright me so°!<br />
I am no girl to be made pale by words.<br />
Yet this thou hast said well, did Rustum stand<br />
Here on this field, there were no fighting then.<br />
But Rustum is far hence, and we stand here.<br /><span class="left">[p.13]</span>
<span class="right">&nbsp;385</span>Begin! thou art more vast, more dread than I,<br />
And thou art proved, I know, and I am young&mdash;<br />
But yet success sways with the breath of Heaven.<br />
And though thou thinkest that thou knowest sure<br />
Thy victory, yet thou canst not surely know.<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;390</span>For we are all, like swimmers in the sea,<br />
Poised on the top of a huge wave of fate,<br />
Which hangs uncertain to which side to fall.<br />
And whether it will heave us up to land,<br />
Or whether it will roll us out to sea,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;395</span>Back out to sea, to the deep waves of death,<br />
We know not, and no search will make us know;<br />
Only the event will teach us in its hour."<br /><br />

He spoke, and Rustum answer'd not, but hurl'd<br />
His spear; down from the shoulder, down it came,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;400</span>As on some partridge, in the corn a hawk,<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#401">401</a></span>That long has tower'd° in the airy clouds,<br />
Drops like a plummet; Sohrab saw it come,<br />
And sprang aside, quick as a flash; the spear<br />
Hiss'd, and went quivering down into the sand,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;405</span>Which it sent flying wide;&mdash;then Sohrab threw<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#406">406</a></span>In turn, and full struck° Rustum's shield; sharp rang,<br />
The iron plates rang sharp, but turn'd the spear.<br />
And Rustum seized his club, which none but he<br />
Could wield; an unlopp'd trunk it was, and huge,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;410</span>Still rough&mdash;like those which men in treeless plains<br />
To build them boats fish from the flooded rivers,<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#412">412</a></span>Hyphasis° or Hydaspes,° when, high up<br />
By their dark springs, the wind in winter-time<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#414">414</a></span>Hath made in Himalayan forests wrack,°<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;415</span>And strewn the channels with torn boughs&mdash;so huge<br />
The club which Rustum lifted now, and struck<br />
One stroke; but again Sohrab sprang aside,<br /><span class="left">[p.14]</span>
<span class="right">°<a href="#418">418</a></span>Lithe as the glancing° snake, and the club came	<br />
Thundering to earth, and leapt from Rustum's hand.<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;420</span>And Rustum follow'd his own blow, and fell<br />
To his knees, and with his fingers clutch'd the sand;<br />
And now might Sohrab have unsheathed his sword,<br />
And pierced the mighty Rustum while he lay<br />
Dizzy, and on his knees, and choked with sand;<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;425</span>But he look'd on, and smiled, nor bared his sword,<br />
But courteously drew back, and spoke, and said:&mdash;<br /><br />

"Thou strik'st too hard! that club of thine will float<br />
Upon the summer-floods, and not my bones.<br />
But rise, and be not wroth! not wroth am I;<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;430</span>No, when I see thee, wrath forsakes my soul.<br />
Thou say'st, thou art not Rustum; be it so!<br />
Who art thou then, that canst so touch my soul?<br />
Boy as I am, I have seen battles too&mdash;<br />
Have waded foremost in their bloody waves,<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#435">435</a></span>And heard their hollow° roar of dying men;<br />
But never was my heart thus touch'd before.<br />
Are they from Heaven, these softenings of the heart?<br />
O thou old warrior, let us yield to Heaven!<br />
Come, plant we here in earth our angry spears,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;440</span>And make a truce, and sit upon this sand,<br />
And pledge each other in red wine, like friends,<br />
And thou shalt talk to me of Rustum's deeds.<br />
There are enough foes in the Persian host,<br />
Whom I may meet, and strike, and feel no pang;<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;445</span>Champions enough Afrasiab has, whom thou<br />
Mayst fight; fight <i class="indent4">them</i>, when they confront thy spear!<br />
But oh, let there be peace 'twixt thee and me!"<br /><br />

He ceased, but while he spake, Rustum had risen,<br />
And stood erect, trembling with rage; his club<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;450</span>He left to lie, but had regain'd his spear,<br /><span class="left">[p.15]</span>
Whose fiery point now in his mail'd right-hand<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#452">452</a></span>Blazed bright and baleful, like that autumn-star,°<br />
The baleful sign of fevers; dust had soil'd<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#454">454</a></span>His stately crest,° and dimm'd his glittering arms.<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;455</span>His breast heaved, his lips foam'd, and twice his voice<br />
Was choked with rage; at last these words broke way:&mdash;<br /><br />

"Girl! nimble with thy feet, not with thy hands!<br />
Curl'd minion, dancer, coiner of sweet words!<br />
Fight, let me hear thy hateful voice no more!<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;460</span>Thou art not in Afrasiab's gardens now<br />
With Tartar girls, with whom thou art wont to dance;<br />
But on the Oxus-sands, and in the dance<br />
Of battle, and with me, who make no play<br />
Of war; I fight it out, and hand to hand.<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;465</span>Speak not to me of truce, and pledge, and wine!<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#466">466</a></span>Remember all thy valour°; try thy feints<br />
And cunning! all the pity I had is gone;<br />
Because thou hast shamed me before both the hosts<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#469">469</a></span>With thy light skipping tricks, and thy girl's wiles.°"<br /><br />

<span class="right">°<a href="#470">470</a></span>He spoke, and Sohrab kindled° at his taunts,<br />
And he too drew his sword; at once they rush'd<br />
Together, as two eagles on one prey<br />
Come rushing down together from the clouds,<br />
One from the east, one from the west; their shields<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;475</span>Bash'd with a clang together, and a din<br />
Rose, such as that the sinewy woodcutters<br />
Make often in the forest's heart at morn,<br />
Of hewing axes, crashing trees&mdash;such blows<br />
Rustum and Sohrab on each other hail'd.<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;480</span>And you would say that sun and stars took part<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#481">481</a></span>In that unnatural° conflict; for a cloud°<br />
Grew suddenly in Heaven, and dark'd the sun<br />
Over the fighters' heads; and a wind rose<br /><span class="left">[p.16]</span>
Under their feet, and moaning swept the plain,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;485</span>And in a sandy whirlwind wrapp'd the pair.<br />
In gloom they twain were wrapp'd, and they alone;<br />
For both the on-looking hosts on either hand<br />
Stood in broad daylight, and the sky was pure,<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#489">489</a></span>And the sun sparkled° on the Oxus stream.<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;490</span>But in the gloom they fought, with bloodshot eyes<br />
And labouring breath; first Rustum struck the shield<br />
Which Sohrab held stiff out; the steel-spiked spear<br />
Rent the tough plates, but fail'd to reach the skin,<br />
And Rustum pluck'd it back with angry groan.<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#495">495</a></span>Then Sohrab with his sword smote Rustum's helm,°<br />
Nor clove its steel quite through; but all the crest<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#497">497</a></span>He shore° away, and that proud horsehair plume,<br />
Never till now defiled, sank to the dust;<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#499">499</a></span>And Rustum bow'd his head°; but then the gloom<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;500</span>Grew blacker, thunder rumbled in the air,<br />
And lightnings rent the cloud; and Ruksh, the horse,<br />
Who stood at hand, utter'd a dreadful cry;&mdash;<br />
No horse's cry was that, most like the roar<br />
Of some pain'd desert-lion, who all day<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;505</span>Hath trail'd the hunter's javelin in his side,<br />
And comes at night to die upon the sand.<br />
The two hosts heard that cry, and quaked for fear,<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#508">508</a></span>And Oxus curdled° as it cross'd his stream.<br />
But Sohrab heard, and quail'd not, but rush'd on,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;510</span>And struck again; and again Rustum bow'd<br />
His head; but this time all the blade, like glass,<br />
Sprang in a thousand shivers on the helm,<br />
And in the hand the hilt remain'd alone.<br />
Then Rustum raised his head; his dreadful eyes<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;515</span>Glared, and he shook on high his menacing spear,<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#516">516</a></span>And shouted: <i class="indent4">Rustum</i>°!&mdash;Sohrab heard that shout,<br /><span class="left">[p.17]</span>
And shrank amazed; back he recoil'd one step,<br />
And scann'd with blinking eyes the advancing form;<br />
And then he stood bewilder'd; and he dropp'd<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;520</span>His covering shield, and the spear pierced his side.<br />
He reel'd, and staggering back, sank to the ground;<br />
And then the gloom dispersed, and the wind fell,<br />
And the bright sun broke forth, and melted all<br />
The cloud; and the two armies saw the pair&mdash;<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;525</span>Saw Rustum standing, safe upon his feet,<br />
And Sohrab, wounded, on the bloody sand.<br /><br />

<span class="right">°<a href="#527">527</a></span>Then, with a bitter smile,° Rustum began:&mdash;<br />
"Sohrab, thou thoughtest in thy mind to kill<br />
A Persian lord this day, and strip his corpse,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;530</span>And bear thy trophies to Afrasiab's tent.<br />
Or else that the great Rustum would come down<br />
Himself to fight, and that thy wiles would move<br />
His heart to take a gift, and let thee go.<br />
And then that all the Tartar host would praise<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;535</span>Thy courage or thy craft, and spread thy fame,<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#536">536</a></span>To glad° thy father in his weak old age.<br />
Fool, thou art slain, and by an unknown man!<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#538">538</a></span>Dearer to the red jackals° shalt thou be<br />
Than to thy friends, and to thy father old."<br /><br />

<span class="right">&nbsp;540</span>And, with a fearless mien, Sohrab replied:&mdash;<br />
"Unknown thou art; yet thy fierce vaunt is vain<br />
Thou dost not slay me, proud and boastful man!<br />
No! Rustum slays me, and this filial heart.<br />
For were I match'd with ten such men as thee,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;545</span>And I were that which till to-day I was,<br />
They should be lying here, I standing there<br />
But that belovéd name unnerved my arm&mdash;<br />
That name, and something, I confess, in thee,<br />
Which troubles all my heart, and made my shield<br /><span class="left">[p.18]</span>
<span class="right">&nbsp;550</span>Fall; and thy spear transfix'd an unarm'd foe.<br />
And now thou boastest, and insult'st my fate.<br />
But hear thou this, fierce man, tremble to hear<br />
The mighty Rustum shall avenge my death!<br />
My father, whom I seek through all the world,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;555</span>He shall avenge my death, and punish thee!"<br /><br />

<span class="right">°<a href="#556">556</a></span>As when some hunter° in the spring hath found	<br />
A breeding eagle sitting on her nest,<br />
Upon the craggy isle of a hill-lake,<br />
And pierced her with an arrow as she rose,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;560</span>And follow'd her to find her where she fell <br />
Far off;&mdash;anon her mate comes winging back<br />
From hunting, and a great way off descries<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#563">563</a></span>His huddling young left sole°; at that, he checks<br />
His pinion, and with short uneasy sweeps<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;565</span>Circles above his eyry, with loud screams<br />
Chiding his mate back to her nest; but she<br />
Lies dying, with the arrow in her side,<br />
In some far stony gorge out of his ken,<br />
A heap of fluttering feathers&mdash;never more<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#570">570</a></span>Shall the lake glass° her, flying over it;<br />
Never the black and dripping precipices<br />
Echo her stormy scream as she sails by&mdash;<br />
As that poor bird flies home, nor knows his loss,<br />
So Rustum knew not his own loss, but stood<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;575</span>Over his dying son, and knew him not.<br /><br />

But, with a cold incredulous voice, he said:&mdash;<br />
"What prate is this of fathers and revenge?<br />
The mighty Rustum never had a son."<br /><br />

And, with a failing voice, Sohrab replied:&mdash;<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;580</span>"Ah yes, he had! and that lost son am I.<br />
Surely the news will one day reach his ear,<br />
Reach Rustum, where he sits, and tarries long,<br /><span class="left">[p.19]</span>
Somewhere, I know not where, but far from here;<br />
And pierce him like a stab, and make him leap<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;585</span>To arms, and cry for vengeance upon thee.<br />
Fierce man, bethink thee, for an only son!<br />
What will that grief, what will that vengeance be?<br />
Oh, could I live, till I that grief had seen!<br />
Yet him I pity not so much, but her,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;590</span>My mother, who in Ader-baijan dwells<br />
With that old king, her father, who grows grey<br />
With age, and rules over the valiant Koords.<br />
Her most I pity, who no more will see<br />
Sohrab returning from the Tartar camp,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;595</span>With spoils and honour, when the war is done.<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#596">596</a></span>But a dark rumour will be bruited up,°<br />
From tribe to tribe, until it reach her ear;<br />
And then will that defenceless woman learn<br />
That Sohrab will rejoice her sight no more,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;600</span>But that in battle with a nameless foe,<br />
By the far-distant Oxus, he is slain."<br /><br />

He spoke; and as he ceased, he wept aloud,<br />
Thinking of her he left, and his own death.<br />
He spoke; but Rustum listen'd, plunged in thought.<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;605</span>Nor did he yet believe it was his son<br />
Who spoke, although he call'd back names he knew;<br />
For he had had sure tidings that the babe,<br />
Which was in Ader-baijan born to him,<br />
Had been a puny girl, no boy at all&mdash;<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;610</span>So that sad mother sent him word, for fear<br />
Rustum should seek the boy, to train in arms&mdash;<br />
And so he deem'd that either Sohrab took,<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#613">613</a></span>By a false boast, the style° of Rustum's son;<br />
Or that men gave it him, to swell his fame.<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;615</span>So deem'd he; yet he listen'd, plunged in thought<br /><span class="left">[p.20]</span>
And his soul set to grief, as the vast tide<br />
Of the bright rocking Ocean sets to shore<br />
At the full moon; tears gather'd in his eyes;<br />
For he remember'd his own early youth,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;620</span>And all its bounding rapture; as, at dawn,<br />
The shepherd from his mountain-lodge descries<br />
A far, bright city, smitten by the sun,<br />
Through many rolling clouds&mdash;so Rustum saw<br />
His youth; saw Sohrab's mother, in her bloom;<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#625">625</a></span>And that old king,° her father, who loved well<br />
His wandering guest, and gave him his fair child<br />
With joy; and all the pleasant life they led,<br />
They three, in that long-distant summer-time&mdash;<br />
The castle, and the dewy woods, and hunt<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;630</span>And hound, and morn on those delightful hills<br />
In Ader-baijan. And he saw that Youth,<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#632">632</a></span>Of age and looks° to be his own dear son,<br />
Piteous and lovely, lying on the sand;<br />
Like some rich hyacinth which by the scythe<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;635</span>Of an unskilful gardener has been cut,<br />
Mowing the garden grass-plots near its bed,<br />
And lies, a fragrant tower of purple bloom,<br />
On the mown, dying grass&mdash;so Sohrab lay,<br />
Lovely in death, upon the common sand.<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;640</span>And Rustum gazed on him with grief, and said:&mdash;<br /><br />

"O Sohrab, thou indeed art such a son<br />
Whom Rustum, wert thou his, might well have loved.<br />
Yet here thou errest, Sohrab, or else men<br />
Have told thee false&mdash;thou art not Rustum's son.<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;645</span>For Rustum had no son; one child he had&mdash;<br />
But one&mdash;a girl; who with her mother now<br />
Plies some light female task, nor dreams of us&mdash;<br />
Of us she dreams not, nor of wounds, nor war."<br /><br />
<span class="left">[p.21]</span>
But Sohrab answer'd him in wrath; for now<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;650</span>The anguish of the deep-fix'd spear grew fierce,<br />
And he desired to draw forth the steel,<br />
And let the blood flow free, and so to die&mdash;<br />
But first he would convince his stubborn foe;<br />
And, rising sternly on one arm, he said:&mdash;<br /><br />

<span class="right">&nbsp;655</span>"Man, who art thou who dost deny my words? <br />
Truth sits upon the lips of dying men,<br />
And falsehood, while I lived, was far from mine.<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#658">658</a></span>I tell thee, prick'd upon this arm° I bear<br />
That seal which Rustum to my mother gave,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;660</span>That she might prick it on the babe she bore."<br /><br />

He spoke; and all the blood left Rustum's cheeks,<br />
And his knees totter'd, and he smote his hand<br />
Against his breast, his heavy mailed hand,<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#664">663</a></span>That the hard iron corslet° clank'd aloud;<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;665</span>And to his heart he press'd the other hand,<br />
And in a hollow voice he spake, and said:&mdash;<br /><br />

"Sohrab, that were a proof which could not lie!<br />
If thou show this, then art thou Rustum's son."<br /><br />

Then, with weak hasty fingers, Sohrab loosed<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;670</span>His belt, and near the shoulder bared his arm,<br />
And show'd a sign in faint vermilion points<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#672">672</a></span>Prick'd; as a cunning° workman, in Pekin,<br />
Pricks with vermilion some clear porcelain vase,<br />
An emperor's gift&mdash;at early morn he paints,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;675</span>And all day long, and, when night comes, the lamp<br />
Lights up his studious forehead and thin hands&mdash;<br />
So delicately prick'd the sign appear'd<br />
On Sohrab's arm, the sign of Rustum's seal.<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#679">679</a></span>It was that griffin,° which of old rear'd Zal,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;680</span>Rustum's great father, whom they left to die,<br />
A helpless babe, among the mountain-rocks;<br /><span class="left">[p.22]</span>
Him that kind creature found, and rear'd, and loved&mdash;<br />
Then Rustum took it for his glorious sign.<br />
And Sohrab bared that image on his arm,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;685</span>And himself scann'd it long with mournful eyes,<br />
And then he touch'd it with his hand and said:&mdash;<br /><br />

"How say'st thou? Is that sign the proper sign<br />
Of Rustum's son, or of some other man's?"<br /><br />

He spoke; but Rustum gazed, and gazed, and stood<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;690</span>Speechless; and then he utter'd one sharp cry:<br />
<i class="indent4">O boy</i>&mdash;<i class="indent4">thy father!</i>&mdash;and his voice choked there.<br />
And then a dark cloud pass'd before his eyes,<br />
And his head swam, and he sank down to earth.<br />
But Sohrab crawl'd to where he lay, and cast<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;695</span>His arms about his neck, and kiss'd his lips,<br />
And with fond faltering fingers stroked his cheeks,<br />
Trying to call him back to life; and life<br />
Came back to Rustum, and he oped his eyes,<br />
And they stood wide with horror; and he seized<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;700</span>In both his hands the dust which lay around,<br />
And threw it on his head, and smirch'd his hair,&mdash;<br />
His hair, and face, and beard, and glittering arms;<br />
And strong convulsive groanings shook his breast,<br />
And his sobs choked him; and he clutch'd his sword,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;705</span>To draw it, and for ever let life out.<br />
But Sohrab saw his thought, and held his hands,<br />
And with a soothing voice he spake, and said:&mdash;<br /><br />

"Father, forbear! for I but meet to-day<br />
The doom which at my birth was written down<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#710">710</a></span>In Heaven, and thou art Heaven's unconscious hand.°<br />
Surely my heart cried out that it was thou,<br />
When first I saw thee; and thy heart spoke too,<br />
I know it! but fate trod those promptings down<br />
Under its iron heel; fate, fate engaged<br /><span class="left">[p.23]</span>
<span class="right">&nbsp;715</span>The strife, and hurl'd me on my father's spear.<br />
But let us speak no more of this! I find<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#717">717</a></span>My father; let me feel that I have found!°<br />
Come, sit beside me on this sand, and take<br />
My head betwixt thy hands, and kiss my cheeks,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;720</span>And wash them with thy tears, and say: <i class="indent4">My son!</i><br />
Quick! quick! for number'd are my sands of life,<br />
And swift; for like the lightning to this field<br />
I came, and like the wind I go away&mdash;<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#724">724</a></span>Sudden, and swift, and like a passing wind.°<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;725</span>But it was writ in Heaven that this should be."<br /><br />

So said he, and his voice released the heart<br />
Of Rustum, and his tears brake forth; he cast<br />
His arms round his son's neck, and wept aloud,<br />
And kiss'd him. And awe fell on both the hosts,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;730</span>When they saw Rustum's grief; and Ruksh, the horse,<br />
With his head bowing to the ground and mane<br />
Sweeping the dust, came near, and in mute woe<br />
First to the one then to the other moved<br />
His head, as if inquiring what their grief<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;735</span>Might mean; and from his dark, compassionate eyes,<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#736">736</a></span>The big warm tears roll'd down, and caked° the sand.<br />
But Rustum chid him with stern voice, and said:&mdash;<br /><br />

"Ruksh, now thou grievest; but, O Ruksh, thy feet<br />
Should first have rotted on their nimble joints,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;740</span>Or ere they brought thy master to this field!"<br /><br />

But Sohrab look'd upon the horse and said:&mdash;<br />
"Is this, then, Ruksh? How often, in past days,<br />
My mother told me of thee, thou brave steed,<br />
My terrible father's terrible horse! and said,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;745</span>That I should one day find thy lord and thee.<br />
Come, let me lay my hand upon thy mane!<br />
O Ruksh, thou art more fortunate than I;<br /><span class="left">[p.24]</span>
For thou hast gone where I shall never go,<br />
And snuff'd the breezes of my father's home.<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;750</span>And thou hast trod the sands of Seistan,<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#751">751</a></span>And seen the River of Helmund,° and the Lake<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#752">752</a></span>Of Zirrah°; and the aged Zal himself<br />
Has often stroked thy neck, and given thee food,<br />
Corn in a golden platter soak'd with wine,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;755</span>And said: <i class="indent4">O Ruksh! bear Rustum well!</i>&mdash;but I<br />
Have never known my grandsire's furrow'd face,<br />
Nor seen his lofty house in Seistan,<br />
Nor slaked my thirst at the clear Helmund stream;<br />
But lodged among my father's foes, and seen<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;760</span>Afrasiab's cities only, Samarcand,<br />
Bokhara, and lone Khiva in the waste,<br />
And the black Toorkmun tents; and only drunk<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#763">763</a></span>The desert rivers, Moorghab° and Tejend,°<br />
Kohik,° and where the Kalmuks feed their sheep,<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#765">765</a></span>The northern Sir°; and this great Oxus stream,<br />
The yellow Oxus, by whose brink I die."<br /><br />

Then, with a heavy groan, Rustum bewail'd:&mdash;<br />
"Oh, that its waves were flowing over me!<br />
Oh, that I saw its grains of yellow silt<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;770</span>Roll tumbling in the current o'er my head!"<br /><br />

But, with a grave mild voice, Sohrab replied:&mdash;<br />
"Desire not that, my father! thou must live.<br />
For some are born to do great deeds, and live,<br />
As some are born to be obscured, and die.<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;775</span>Do thou the deeds I die too young to do,<br />
And reap a second glory in thine age;<br />
Thou art my father, and thy gain is mine.<br />
But come! thou seest this great host of men<br />
Which follow me; I pray thee, slay not these!<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;780</span>Let me entreat for them; what have they done?<br /><span class="left">[p.25]</span>
They follow'd me, my hope, my fame, my star.<br />
Let them all cross the Oxus back in peace.<br />
But me thou must bear hence, not send with them,<br />
But carry me with thee to Seistan,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;785</span>And place me on a bed, and mourn for me,<br />
Thou, and the snow-hair'd Zal, and all thy friends.<br />
And thou must lay me in that lovely earth,<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#788">788</a></span>And heap a stately mound° above my bones,<br />
And plant a far-seen pillar over all.<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;790</span>That so the passing horseman on the waste<br />
May see my tomb a great way off, and cry:<br />
<i class="indent4">Sohrab, the mighty Rustum's son, lies there,<br />
Whom his great father did in ignorance kill!</i><br />
And I be not forgotten in my grave."<br /><br />

<span class="right">&nbsp;795</span>And, with a mournful voice, Rustum replied:&mdash;<br />
"Fear not! as thou hast said, Sohrab, my son,<br />
So shall it be; for I will burn my tents,<br />
And quit the host, and bear thee hence with me,<br />
And carry thee away to Seistan,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;800</span>And place thee on a bed, and mourn for thee,<br />
With the snow-headed Zal, and all my friends.<br />
And I will lay thee in that lovely earth,<br />
And heap a stately mound above thy bones,<br />
And plant a far-seen pillar over all,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;805</span>And men shall not forget thee in thy grave.<br />
And I will spare thy host; yea, let them go!<br />
Let them all cross the Oxus back in peace!<br />
What should I do with slaying any more?<br />
For would that all that I have ever slain<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;810</span>Might be once more alive; my bitterest foes,<br />
And they who were call'd champions in their time,<br />
And through whose death I won that fame I have&mdash;<br />
And I were nothing but a common man,<br /><span class="left">[p.26]</span>
A poor, mean soldier, and without renown,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;815</span>So thou mightest live too, my son, my son!<br />
Or rather would that I, even I myself,<br />
Might now be lying on this bloody sand,<br />
Near death, and by an ignorant stroke of thine,<br />
Not thou of mine! and I might die, not thou;<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;820</span>And I, not thou, be borne to Seistan;<br />
And Zal might weep above my grave, not thine;<br />
And say: <i class="indent4">O son, I weep thee not too sore,<br />
For willingly, I know, thou met'st thine end!</i><br />
But now in blood and battles was my youth,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;825</span>And full of blood and battles is my age,<br />
And I shall never end this life of blood."<br /><br />

Then, at the point of death, Sohrab replied:&mdash;<br />
"A life of blood indeed, thou dreadful man!<br />
But thou shalt yet have peace; only not now,<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#830">830</a></span>Not yet! but thou shalt have it on that day,°<br />
When thou shalt sail in a high-masted ship,<br />
Thou and the other peers of Kai Khosroo,<br />
Returning home over the salt blue sea,<br />
From laying thy dear master in his grave."<br /><br />

<span class="right">&nbsp;835</span>And Rustum gazed in Sohrab's face, and said:&mdash;<br />
"Soon be that day, my son, and deep that sea!<br />
Till then, if fate so wills, let me endure."<br /><br />

He spoke; and Sohrab smiled on him, and took<br />
The spear, and drew it from his side, and eased<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;840</span>His wound's imperious anguish; but the blood<br />
Came welling from the open gash, and life<br />
Flow'd with the stream;&mdash;all down his cold white side<br />
The crimson torrent ran, dim now and soil'd,<br />
Like the soil'd tissue of white violets<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;845</span>Left, freshly gather'd, on their native bank,<br />
By children whom their nurses call with haste<br /><span class="left">[p.27]</span>
Indoors from the sun's eye; his head droop'd low,<br />
His limbs grew slack; motionless, white, he lay&mdash;<br />
White, with eyes closed; only when heavy gasps,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;850</span>Deep heavy gasps quivering through all his frame,<br />
Convulsed him back to life, he open'd them,<br />
And fix'd them feebly on his father's face;<br />
Till now all strength was ebb'd, and from his limbs<br />
Unwillingly the spirit fled away,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;855</span>Regretting the warm mansion which it left,<br />
And youth, and bloom, and this delightful world.<br /><br />

So, on the bloody sand, Sohrab lay dead;<br />
And the great Rustum drew his horseman's cloak<br />
Down o'er his face, and sate by his dead son.<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;860</span>As those black granite pillars, once high-rear'd<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#861">861</a></span>By Jemshid in Persepolis,° to bear<br />
His house, now 'mid their broken flights of steps<br />
Lie prone, enormous, down the mountain side&mdash;<br />
So in the sand lay Rustum by his son.<br /><br />

<span class="right">&nbsp;865</span>And night came down over the solemn waste,<br />
And the two gazing hosts, and that sole pair,<br />
And darken'd all; and a cold fog, with night,<br />
Crept from the Oxus. Soon a hum arose,<br />
As of a great assembly loosed, and fires<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;870</span>Began to twinkle through the fog; for now<br />
Both armies moved to camp, and took their meal;<br />
The Persians took it on the open sands<br />
Southward, the Tartars by the river marge;<br />
And Rustum and his son were left alone.<br /><br />

<span class="right">&nbsp;875</span>But the majestic river floated on,<br />
Out of the mist and hum of that low land,<br />
Into the frosty starlight, and there moved,<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#878">878</a></span>Rejoicing, through the hush'd Chorasmian° waste,<br />
Under the solitary moon;&mdash;he flow'd<br /><span class="left">[p.28]</span>
<span class="right">°<a href="#880">880</a></span>Right for the polar star,° past Orgunjè,°<br />
Brimming, and bright, and large; then sands begin<br />
To hem his watery march, and dam his streams,<br />
And split his currents; that for many a league<br />
The shorn and parcell'd Oxus strains along<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;885</span>Through beds of sand and matted rushy isles&mdash;<br />
Oxus, forgetting the bright speed he had<br />
In his high mountain-cradle in Pamere,<br />
A foil'd circuitous wanderer&mdash;till at last<br />
The long'd-for dash of waves is heard, and wide<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#890">890</a></span>His luminous home° of waters opens, bright<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#891">891</a></span>And tranquil, from whose floor the new-bathed stars°<br />

Children dear, was it yesterday<br />
(Call yet once) that she went away?<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;50</span>Once she sate with you and me,<br />
On a red gold throne in the heart of the sea,<br />
And the youngest sate on her knee.<br />
She comb'd its bright hair, and she tended it well,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#54m">54</a></span>When down swung the sound of a far-off bell.°<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;55</span>She sigh'd, she look'd up through the clear green sea;<br />
She said: "I must go, for my kinsfolk pray<br />
In the little grey church on the shore to-day.<br />
'Twill be Easter-time in the world&mdash;ah me!<br />
And I lose my poor soul, Merman! here with thee."<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;60</span>I said: "Go up, dear heart, through the waves;<br />
Say thy prayer, and come back to the kind sea-caves!"<br />
She smiled, she went up through the surf in the bay.<br />
Children dear, was it yesterday?<br /><br />

  Children dear, were we long alone?<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;65</span>"The sea grows stormy, the little ones moan;<br />
Long prayers," I said, "in the world they say;<br />
Come!" I said; and we rose through the surf in the bay.<br />
We went up the beach, by the sandy down<br />
Where the sea-stocks bloom, to the white-wall'd town;<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;70</span>Through the narrow paved streets, where all was still,<br />
To the little grey church on the windy hill.<br />
From the church came a murmur of folk at their prayers,<br />
But we stood without in the cold blowing airs.<br />
We climb'd on the graves, on the stones worn with rains,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;75</span>And we gazed up the aisle through the small leaded panes.<br />
She sate by the pillar; we saw her clear:<br />
"Margaret, hist! come quick, we are here!<br />
Dear heart," I said, "we are long alone;<br />
The sea grows stormy, the little ones moan."<br /><span class="left">[p.34]</span>
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;80</span>But, ah, she gave me never a look,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#81m">81</a></span>For her eyes were seal'd° to the holy book!<br />
Loud prays the priest; shut stands the door.<br />

Come away, come down, call no more!<br /><br />

  <span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;85</span>Down, down, down! <br />
Down to the depths of the sea!<br />
She sits at her wheel in the humming town,
Singing most joyfully.<br />

And so she sings her fill,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;95</span>Singing most joyfully,<br />
Till the spindle drops from her hand,<br />
And the whizzing wheel stands still.<br />
She steals to the window, and looks at the sand,<br />
And over the sand at the sea;<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;100</span>And her eyes are set in a stare; <br />
And anon there breaks a sigh,<br />
And anon there drops a tear,<br />
From a sorrow-clouded eye,<br />
And a heart sorrow-laden,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;105</span>A long, long sigh;<br />
For the cold strange eyes of a little Mermaiden<br />
And the gleam of her golden hair.<br /><br />

Come children, come down!<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;110</span>The hoarse wind blows coldly;<br />
Lights shine in the town.<br /><span class="left">[p.35]</span>

And alone dwell for ever<br />
The kings of the sea."<br /><br />

But, children, at midnight,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;125</span>When soft the winds blow,<br />

When spring-tides are low;<br />

<span class="right">&nbsp;135</span>The ebb-tide leaves dry.<br />
We will gaze, from the sand-hills,<br />
At the white, sleeping town;<br />

And then come back down.<br />

She raised her eyes upon his face&mdash;<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;320</span>Not with a look of wounded pride,<br />
A look as if the heart complained&mdash;<br />
Her look was like a sad embrace;<br />
The gaze of one who can divine<br />
A grief, and sympathise.<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;325</span>Sweet flower! thy children's eyes<br />
Are not more innocent than thine.<br />

Like helpless birds in the warm nest,<br />

Of buffeting wind and surging tide<br />
Through many a room and corridor.<br />

Makes their chamber as bright as day.<br /><span class="left">[p.47]</span>

<span class="right">&nbsp;365</span>The bare heaths spreading, clear as day,<br />
Moor behind moor, far, far away,<br />
Into the heart of Brittany.<br />
And here and there, lock'd by the land,<br /><span class="left">[p.48]</span>
Long inlets of smooth glittering sea,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;370</span>And many a stretch of watery sand<br />
All shining in the white moon-beams&mdash;<br />

<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5</span><i>Iseult</i>. Blame me not, poor sufferer! that I tarried;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Bound I was, I could not break the band.<br />
Chide not with the past, but feel the present!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;I am here&mdash;we meet&mdash;I hold thy hand.<br /><br />

Fear not now that men should tax thine honour!<br />

   &nbsp;&nbsp;What, I hear these bitter words from thee?<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;15</span>Sick with grief I am, and faint with travel&mdash;<br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;Take my hand&mdash;dear Tristram, look on me!<br /><br />
<span class="left">[p.49]</span>

   &nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the spray is on thy cloak and hair.<br />
But thy dark eyes are not dimm'd, proud Iseult!<br />
   <span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;20</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;And thy beauty never was more fair.<br /><br />

<i>Iseult</i>. Ah, harsh flatterer! let alone my beauty!<br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;I, like thee, have left my youth afar.<br />
Take my hand, and touch these wasted fingers&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; See my cheek and lips, how white they are!<br /><br />

<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;25</span><i>Tristram</i>. Thou art paler&mdash;but thy sweet charm, Iseult!<br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;Would not fade with the dull years away.<br />
Ah, how fair thou standest in the moonlight!<br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;I forgive thee, Iseult!&mdash;thou wilt stay?<br /><br />

<i>Iseult</i>. Fear me not, I will be always with thee;<br />
  <span class="right"> &nbsp;&nbsp;30</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;I will watch thee, tend thee, soothe thy pain;<br />
Sing thee tales of true, long-parted lovers,<br />

   &nbsp;&nbsp;Something alter'd in thy courtly tone.<br />

   &nbsp;&nbsp;Love like mine is alter'd in the breast;<br />
Courtly life is light and cannot reach it&mdash;<br />
  <span class="right"> &nbsp;&nbsp;40</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! it lives, because so deep-suppress'd!<br /><br />

What, thou think'st men speak in courtly chambers<br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;Words by which the wretched are consoled?<br />
What, thou think'st this aching brow was cooler,<br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;Circled, Tristram, by a band of gold?<br /><br />
<span class="left">[p.50]</span>
<span class="right"> &nbsp;&nbsp;45</span>Royal state with Marc, my deep-wrong'd husband&mdash;<br />

Thee, a pining exile in thy forest,<br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;Me, a smiling queen upon my throne?<br /><br />

Vain and strange debate, where both have suffer'd,<br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;Both have pass'd a youth consumed and sad,<br />

   &nbsp;&nbsp;And have now short space for being glad!<br /><br />

That a former rival shares her office,<br />
  <span class="right"> &nbsp;&nbsp;60</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;When she sees her humbled, pale, and still.<br /><br />

Hush, no words! that smile, I see, forgives me.<br />
  <span class="right"> &nbsp;&nbsp;70</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;I am now thy nurse, I bid thee sleep.<br />

<span class="left">[p.51]</span>

   &nbsp;&nbsp;Bend&mdash;bend down!&mdash;I yet have much to say.<br /><br />

When the fierce pains took her in the forest,<br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;The deep draughts of death, in bearing me.<br /><br />

<span class="right"> &nbsp;&nbsp;85</span>"Son," she said, "thy name shall be of sorrow;<br />

Close mine eyes, then seek the princess Iseult;<br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;Speak her fair, she is of royal blood!<br />
<span class="right"> &nbsp;&nbsp;95</span>Say, I will'd so, that thou stay beside me&mdash;<br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;She will grant it; she is kind and good.<br /><br />

Now to sail the seas of death I leave thee&mdash;<br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;One last kiss upon the living shore!<br /><br />

You see them clear&mdash;the moon shines bright.<br />
Slow, slow and softly, where she stood,<br />
She sinks upon the ground;&mdash;her hood<br />
Has fallen back; her arms outspread<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;105</span>Still hold her lover's hand; her head<br />
Is bow'd, half-buried, on the bed.<br />
O'er the blanch'd sheet her raven hair<br />
Lies in disorder'd streams; and there,<br />
Strung like white stars, the pearls still are,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;110</span>And the golden bracelets, heavy and rare,<br />
Flash on her white arms still.<br />
The very same which yesternight<br />

When the feast was gay and the laughter loud<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;115</span>In Tyntagel's palace proud.<br />
But then they deck'd a restless ghost<br />
With hot-flush'd cheeks and brilliant eyes,<br />
And quivering lips on which the tide<br />
Of courtly speech abruptly died,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;120</span>And a glance which over the crowded floor,<br />
The dancers, and the festive host,<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#122t2">122</a></span>Flew ever to the door.°<br />
That the knights eyed her in surprise,<br />
And the dames whispered scoffingly:<br />

But yesternight and she would be<br />
As pale and still as wither'd flowers,<br />

And has a colour in her cheeks;<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;130</span>Christ keep us from such fantasy!"&mdash;<br /><span class="left">[p.53]</span>
Yes, now the longing is o'erpast,<br />

And though the bed-clothes hide her face,<br />
Yet were it lifted to the light,<br />
The sweet expression of her brow<br />
Would charm the gazer, till his thought<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;140</span>Erased the ravages of time,<br />

A freshness back as of her prime&mdash;<br />
So healing is her quiet now.<br />

Her younger rival's purest grace.<br /><br />

With his pack round him, and delays.<br />
He stares and stares, with troubled face,<br />
At this huge, gleam-lit fireplace,<br />
At that bright, iron-figured door,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;160</span>And those blown rushes on the floor.<br />
He gazes down into the room<br />
With heated cheeks and flurried air,<br /><span class="left">[p.54]</span>

<h3><a href="#IB">ISEULT OF BRITTANY</a><a name="BRITTANY">°</a></h3>
<p class="indent4">
A year had flown, and o'er the sea away,<br />
In Cornwall, Tristram and Queen Iseult lay;<br />
In King Marc's chapel, in Tyntagel old&mdash;<br />
There in a ship they bore those lovers cold.<br /><br />

<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5</span>The young surviving Iseult, one bright day,<br />
Had wander'd forth. Her children were at play<br />
In a green circular hollow in the heath<br />
Which borders the sea-shore&mdash;a country path<br />
Creeps over it from the till'd fields behind.<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;10</span>The hollow's grassy banks are soft-inclined,<br />
And to one standing on them, far and near<br />
The lone unbroken view spreads bright and clear<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#13t3">13</a></span>Over the waste. This cirque° of open ground<br />
Is light and green; the heather, which all round<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;15</span>Creeps thickly, grows not here; but the pale grass<br />
Is strewn with rocks, and many a shiver'd mass<br />
Of vein'd white-gleaming quartz, and here and there<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#18t3">18</a></span>Dotted with holly-trees and juniper.°<br />
In the smooth centre of the opening stood<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;20</span>Three hollies side by side, and made a screen,<br />
Warm with the winter-sun, of burnish'd green<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#22t3">22</a></span>With scarlet berries gemm'd, the fell-fare's° food.<br />
Under the glittering hollies Iseult stands,<br />
Watching her children play; their little hands<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;25</span>Are busy gathering spars of quartz, and streams<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#26t3">26</a></span>Of stagshorn° for their hats; anon, with screams<br /><span class="left">[p.56]</span>
Of mad delight they drop their spoils, and bound<br />
Among the holly-clumps and broken ground,<br />
Racing full speed, and startling in their rush<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;30</span>The fell-fares and the speckled missel-thrush<br />
Out of their glossy coverts;&mdash;but when now<br />
Their cheeks were flush'd, and over each hot brow,<br />
Under the feather'd hats of the sweet pair,<br />
In blinding masses shower'd the golden hair&mdash;<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;35</span>Then Iseult call'd them to her, and the three<br />
Cluster'd under the holly-screen, and she<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#37t3">37</a></span>Told them an old-world Breton history.°<br /><br />

Warm in their mantles wrapt the three stood there,<br />
Under the hollies, in the clear still air&mdash;<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;40</span>Mantles with those rich furs deep glistering<br />
Which Venice ships do from swart Egypt bring.<br />
Long they stay'd still&mdash;then, pacing at their ease,<br />
Moved up and down under the glossy trees.<br />
But still, as they pursued their warm dry road,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;45</span>From Iseult's lips the unbroken story flow'd,<br />
And still the children listen'd, their blue eyes<br />
Fix'd on their mother's face in wide surprise;<br />
Nor did their looks stray once to the sea-side,<br />
Nor to the brown heaths round them, bright and wide,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;50</span>Nor to the snow, which, though 'twas all away<br />
From the open heath, still by the hedgerows lay,<br />
Nor to the shining sea-fowl, that with screams<br />
Bore up from where the bright Atlantic gleams,<br />
Swooping to landward; nor to where, quite clear,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;55</span>The fell-fares settled on the thickets near.<br />
And they would still have listen'd, till dark night<br />
Came keen and chill down on the heather bright;<br />
But, when the red glow on the sea grew cold,<br /><span class="left">[p.57]</span>
And the grey turrets of the castle old<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;60</span>Look'd sternly through the frosty evening-air, <br />
Then Iseult took by the hand those children fair,<br />
And brought her tale to an end, and found the path,<br />
And led them home over the darkening heath.<br /><br />

And is she happy? Does she see unmoved<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;65</span>The days in which she might have lived and loved<br />
Slip without bringing bliss slowly away,<br />
One after one, to-morrow like to-day?<br />
Joy has not found her yet, nor ever will&mdash;<br />
Is it this thought which, makes her mien so still,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;70</span>Her features so fatigued, her eyes, though sweet,<br />
So sunk, so rarely lifted save to meet<br />
Her children's? She moves slow; her voice alone<br />
Hath yet an infantine and silver tone,<br />
But even that comes languidly; in truth,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;75</span>She seems one dying in a mask of youth.<br />
And now she will go home, and softly lay<br />
Her laughing children in their beds, and play<br />
Awhile with them before they sleep; and then<br />
She'll light her silver lamp, which fishermen<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;80</span>Dragging their nets through the rough waves, afar,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#81t3">81</a></span>Along this iron coast,° know like a star,°<br />
And take her broidery-frame, and there she'll sit<br />
Hour after hour, her gold curls sweeping it;<br />
Lifting her soft-bent head only to mind<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;85</span>Her children, or to listen to the wind.<br />
And when the clock peals midnight, she will move<br />
Her work away, and let her fingers rove<br />
Across the shaggy brows of Tristram's hound<br />
Who lies, guarding her feet, along the ground;<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;90</span>Or else she will fall musing, her blue eyes<br /><span class="left">[p.58]</span>
Fixt, her slight hands clasp'd on her lap; then rise,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#92t3">92</a></span>And at her prie-dieu° kneel, until she have told<br />
Her rosary-beads of ebony tipp'd with gold,<br />
Then to her soft sleep&mdash;and to-morrow'll be<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;95</span>To-day's exact repeated effigy.<br /><br />

Yes, it is lonely for her in her hall.<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#97t3">97</a></span>The children, and the grey-hair'd seneschal,°<br />
Her women, and Sir Tristram's aged hound,<br />
Are there the sole companions to be found.<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;100</span>But these she loves; and noiser life than this<br />
She would find ill to bear, weak as she is.<br />
She has her children, too, and night and day<br />
Is with them; and the wide heaths where they play,<br />
The hollies, and the cliff, and the sea-shore,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;105</span>The sand, the sea-birds, and the distant sails,<br />
These are to her dear as to them; the tales<br />
With which this day the children she beguiled<br />
She gleaned from Breton grandames, when a child,<br />
In every hut along this sea-coast wild.<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;110</span>She herself loves them still, and, when they are told,<br />
Can forget all to hear them, as of old.<br /><br />

Dear saints, it is not sorrow, as I hear,<br />
Not suffering, which shuts up eye and ear<br />
To all that has delighted them before,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;115</span>And lets us be what we were once no more.<br />
No, we may suffer deeply, yet retain<br />
Power to be moved and soothed, for all our pain,<br />
By what of old pleased us, and will again.<br />
No, 'tis the gradual furnace of the world,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;120</span>In whose hot air our spirits are upcurl'd<br />
Until they crumble, or else grow like steel&mdash;<br /><span class="left">[p.59]</span>
Which kills in us the bloom, the youth, the spring&mdash;<br />
Which leaves the fierce necessity to feel,<br />
But takes away the power&mdash;this can avail,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;125</span>By drying up our joy in everything,<br />
To make our former pleasures all seem stale.<br />
This, or some tyrannous single thought, some fit<br />
Of passion, which subdues our souls to it,<br />
Till for its sake alone we live and move&mdash;<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;130</span>Call it ambition, or remorse, or love&mdash;<br />
This too can change us wholly, and make seem<br />
All which we did before, shadow and dream.<br /><br />

And yet, I swear, it angers me to see<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#134t3">134</a></span>How this fool passion gulls° men potently;<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;135</span>Being, in truth, but a diseased unrest,<br />
And an unnatural overheat at best.<br />
How they are full of languor and distress<br />
Not having it; which when they do possess,<br />
They straightway are burnt up with fume and care,<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#140t3">140</a></span>And spend their lives in posting here and there°<br />
Where this plague drives them; and have little ease,<br />
Are furious with themselves, and hard to please.<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#143t3">143</a></span>Like that bold Cæsar,° the famed Roman wight,<br />
Who wept at reading of a Grecian knight<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;145</span>Who made a name at younger years than he;<br />
Or that renown'd mirror of chivalry,<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#150t3">147</a></span>Prince Alexander,° Philip's peerless son,<br />
Who carried the great war from Macedon<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#150t3">149</a></span>Into the Soudan's° realm, and thundered on<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;150</span>To die at thirty-five in Babylon.<br /><br />

What tale did Iseult to the children say,<br />
Under the hollies, that bright-winter's day?<br /><span class="left">[p.60]</span>
She told them of the fairy-haunted land<br />
Away the other side of Brittany,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;155</span>Beyond the heaths, edged by the lonely sea;<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#224t3">156</a></span>Of the deep forest-glades of Broce-liande,°<br />
Through whose green boughs the golden sunshine creeps<br />
Where Merlin by the enchanted thorn-tree sleeps.<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#224t3">159</a></span>For here he came with the fay° Vivian,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;160</span>One April, when the warm days first began.<br />
He was on foot, and that false fay, his friend,<br />
On her white palfrey; here he met his end,<br />
In these lone sylvan glades, that April-day.<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#224t3">164</a></span>This tale of Merlin and the lovely fay°<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;165</span>Was the one Iseult chose, and she brought clear<br />
Before the children's fancy him and her.<br /><br />

Blowing between the stems, the forest-air<br />
Had loosen'd the brown locks of Vivian's hair,<br />
Which play'd on her flush'd cheek, and her blue eyes<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;170</span>Sparkled with mocking glee and exercise.<br />
Her palfrey's flanks were mired and bathed in sweat,<br />
For they had travell'd far and not stopp'd yet.<br />
A brier in that tangled wilderness<br />
Had scored her white right hand, which she allows<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;175</span>To rest ungloved on her green riding-dress;<br />
The other warded off the drooping boughs.<br />
But still she chatted on, with her blue eyes<br />
Fix'd full on Merlin's face, her stately prize.<br />
Her 'haviour had the morning's fresh clear grace,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;180</span>The spirit of the woods was in her face.<br />
She look'd so witching fair, that learned wight<br />
Forgot his craft, and his best wits took flight;<br />
And he grew fond, and eager to obey<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#224t3">184</a></span>His mistress, use her empire° as she may.<br /><span class="left">[p.61]</span>
<span class="right">&nbsp;185</span>They came to where the brushwood ceased, and day <br />
Peer'd 'twixt the stems; and the ground broke away,<br />
In a sloped sward down to a brawling brook;<br />
And up as high as where they stood to look<br />
On the brook's farther side was clear, but then<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;190</span>The underwood and trees began again.<br />
This open glen was studded thick with thorns<br />
Then white with blossom; and you saw the horns,<br />
Through last year's fern, of the shy fallow-deer<br />
Who come at noon down to the water here.<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;195</span>You saw the bright-eyed squirrels dart along<br />
Under the thorns on the green sward; and strong<br />
The blackbird whistled from the dingles near,<br />
And the weird chipping of the woodpecker<br />
Rang lonelily and sharp; the sky was fair,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;200</span>And a fresh breath of spring stirr'd everywhere.<br />
Merlin and Vivian stopp'd on the slope's brow,<br />
To gaze on the light sea of leaf and bough<br />
Which glistering plays all round them, lone and mild.<br />
As if to itself the quiet forest smiled.<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;205</span>Upon the brow-top grew a thorn, and here<br />
The grass was dry and moss'd, and you saw clear<br />
Across the hollow; white anemones<br />
Starr'd the cool turf, and clumps of primroses<br />
Ran out from the dark underwood behind.<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;210</span>No fairer resting-place a man could find.<br />
"Here let us halt," said Merlin then; and she<br />
Nodded, and tied her palfrey to a tree.<br /><br />

They sate them down together, and a sleep<br />
Fell upon Merlin, more like death, so deep.<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;215&nbsp;</span>Her finger on her lips, then Vivian rose<br />
And from her brown-lock'd head the wimple throws,<br /><span class="left">[p.62]</span>
And takes it in her hand, and waves it over<br />
The blossom'd thorn-tree and her sleeping lover.<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#224t3">219</a></span>Nine times she waved the fluttering wimple° round,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;220</span>And made a little plot of magic ground.<br />
And in that daised circle, as men say,<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#224t3">222</a></span>Is Merlin prisoner° till the judgment-day;<br />
But she herself whither she will can rove&mdash;<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#224-2t3">224</a></span>For she was passing weary of his love.°

Hark! the game's on foot; they scatter!&mdash;<br />

In the dull October evening,<br />
  <span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;30</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Down the leaf-strewn forest-road,<br />
To the castle, past the drawbridge,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Came the hunters with their load.<br /><br />

In the hall, with sconces blazing,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Ladies waiting round her seat,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#35cb">35</a></span>Clothed in smiles, beneath the dais°<br />

"&mdash;'Tis my lord come back from hunting&mdash;"<br />
  <span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;40</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Duchess claps her hands.<br /><br />

Slow and tired, came the hunters&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Stopp'd in darkness in the court.<br />
"&mdash;Ho, this way, ye laggard hunters!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;To the hall! What sport? What sport?"&mdash;<br /><br />
<span class="left">[p.65]</span>
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;45</span>Slow they enter'd with their master;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;In the hall they laid him down.<br />
On his coat were leaves and blood-stains,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;On his brow an angry frown.<br /><br />

Dead her princely youthful husband<br />
  <span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;50</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay before his youthful wife,<br />
Bloody, 'neath the flaring sconces&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;And the sight froze all her life.</p>

In Vienna, by the Danube,<br />

Till that hour she never sorrow'd;<br />
  <span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;60</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;But from then she never smiled.<br /><br />

'Mid the Savoy mountain valleys<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Far from town or haunt of man,<br />
Stands a lonely church, unfinish'd,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Which the Duchess Maud began;<br /><br />

<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;65</span>Old, that Duchess stern began it,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;In grey age, with palsied hands;<br />

Stones are sawing, hammers ringing;<br />

In the Savoy mountain-meadows,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;By the stream, below the pines.<br /><br />

On her palfry white the Duchess<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Sate and watch'd her working train&mdash;<br />

There she sate, and watch'd the builders,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Till the Church was roof'd and done.<br />
Last of all, the builders rear'd her<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;In the nave a tomb of stone.<br /><br />

<span class="right">&nbsp;105</span>On the tomb two forms they sculptured,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Lifelike in the marble pale&mdash;<br />
One, the Duke in helm and armour;<br />

<h3>THE CHURCH</h3>
<p class="indent4">
Upon the glistening leaden roof<br />
Of the new Pile, the sunlight shines;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;The stream goes leaping by.<br />
The hills are clothed with pines sun-proof;<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5</span>'Mid bright green fields, below the pines,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Stands the Church on high.<br />
What Church is this, from men aloof?&mdash;<br />
'Tis the Church of Brou.<br /><br />

At sunrise, from their dewy lair<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;10</span>Crossing the stream, the kine are seen <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Round the wall to stray&mdash;<br /><span class="left">[p.68]</span>
The churchyard wall that clips the square<br />
Of open hill-sward fresh and green<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Where last year they lay.<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;15</span>But all things now are order'd fair<br />
Round the Church of Brou.<br /><br />

<span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#17cb2">17</a></span>On Sundays, at the matin-chime,°<br />
The Alpine peasants, two and three,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Climb up here to pray;<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;20</span>Burghers and dames, at summer's prime,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#21cb2">21</a></span>Ride out to church from Chambery,°<br />
  <span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#22cb2">22</a></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dight° with mantles gay.<br />
But else it is a lonely time<br />
Round the Church of Brou.<br /><br />

<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;25</span>On Sundays, too, a priest doth come	<br />
From the wall'd town beyond the pass,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Down the mountain-way;<br />
And then you hear the organ's hum,<br />
You hear the white-robed priest say mass,<br />
  <span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;30</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the people pray.<br />
But else the woods and fields are dumb<br />
Round the Church of Brou.<br /><br />

And after church, when mass is done,<br />
The people to the nave repair<br />
  <span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;35</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Round the tomb to stray;<br />
And marvel at the Forms of stone,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#37cb2">37</a></span>And praise the chisell'd broideries° rare&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Then they drop away.<br />
The princely Pair are left alone<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;40</span>In the Church of Brou.</p>

<h3>THE TOMB</h3>
<p class="indent4">
So rest, for ever rest, O princely Pair!<br />
In your high church, 'mid the still mountain-air,<br />
Where horn, and hound, and vassals never come.<br />

<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;°<a href="#6cb3">6</a></span>On aisle, and transept,° and your marble grave;<br />
Where thou, young Prince! shalt never more arise<br />
From the fringed mattress where thy Duchess lies,<br />
On autumn-mornings, when the bugle sounds,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;10</span>And ride across the drawbridge with thy hounds <br />
To hunt the boar in the crisp woods till eve;<br />
And thou, O Princess! shalt no more receive,<br />
Thou and thy ladies, in the hall of state,<br />
The jaded hunters with their bloody freight,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;15</span>Coming benighted to the castle-gate.<br /><br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;So sleep, for ever sleep, O marble Pair!<br />
Or, if ye wake, let it be then, when fair<br />
On the carved western front a flood of light<br />
Streams from the setting sun, and colours bright<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;20</span>Prophets, transfigured Saints, and Martyrs brave, <br />

And from your broider'd pillows lift your heads,<br />
And rise upon your cold white marble beds;<br /><span class="left">[p.70]</span>
And, looking down on the warm rosy tints,<br />
Which chequer, at your feet, the illumined flints,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;30</span>Say: <i class="indent4">What is this? we are in bliss&mdash;forgiven&mdash;</i><br />
<i class="indent4">Behold the pavement of the courts of Heaven!</i><br />
Or let it be on autumn nights, when rain<br />
Doth rustlingly above your heads complain<br />
On the smooth leaden roof, and on the walls<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;35</span>Shedding her pensive light at intervals<br />
The moon through the clere-story windows shines,<br />
And the wind washes through the mountain-pines.<br />
Then, gazing up 'mid the dim pillars high,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#39cb3">39</a></span>The foliaged marble forest° where ye lie,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;40</span><i class="indent4">Hush</i>, ye will say, <i class="indent4">it is eternity!</i><br />
<i class="indent4">This is the glimmering verge of Heaven, and these<br />

And, in the sweeping of the wind, your ear<br />
The passage of the Angels' wings will hear,<br />

<h2>A <a name="DREAM">DREAM</a></h2>
<p class="indent4">
Was it a dream? We sail'd, I thought we sail'd,<br />
Martin and I, down the green Alpine stream,<br />
Border'd, each bank, with pines; the morning sun,<br />
On the wet umbrage of their glossy tops,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5</span>On the red pinings of their forest-floor, <br />
Drew a warm scent abroad; behind the pines<br />
The mountain-skirts, with all their sylvan change<br />
Of bright-leaf'd chestnuts and moss'd walnut-trees<br />
And the frail scarlet-berried ash, began.<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;10</span>Swiss chalets glitter'd on the dewy slopes,<br />
And from some swarded shelf, high up, there came<br />
Notes of wild pastoral music&mdash;over all<br />
Ranged, diamond-bright, the eternal wall of snow.<br />
Upon the mossy rocks at the stream's edge,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;15</span>Back'd by the pines, a plank-built cottage stood,<br />
Bright in the sun; the climbing gourd-plant's leaves<br />
Muffled its walls, and on the stone-strewn roof<br />
Lay the warm golden gourds; golden, within,<br />
Under the eaves, peer'd rows of Indian corn.<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;20</span>We shot beneath the cottage with the stream.<br />
On the brown, rude-carved balcony, two forms<br />
Came forth&mdash;Olivia's, Marguerite! and thine.<br /><span class="left">[p.75]</span>
Clad were they both in white, flowers in their breast;<br />
Straw hats bedeck'd their heads, with ribbons blue,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;25</span>Which danced, and on their shoulders, fluttering, play'd.<br />
They saw us, they conferred; their bosoms heaved,<br />
And more than mortal impulse fill'd their eyes.<br />
Their lips moved; their white arms, waved eagerly,<br />
Flash'd once, like falling streams; we rose, we gazed.<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;30</span>One moment, on the rapid's top, our boat<br />
Hung poised&mdash;and then the darting river of Life<br />
(Such now, methought, it was), the river of Life,<br />
Loud thundering, bore us by; swift, swift it foam'd,<br />
Black under cliffs it raced, round headlands shone.<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;35</span>Soon the plank'd cottage by the sun-warm'd pines<br />
Faded&mdash;the moss&mdash;the rocks; us burning plains,<br />
Bristled with cities, us the sea received.</p>

Only a driving wreck.<br />

<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;65</span>Grasping the rudder hard,<br />
Still bent to make some port he knows not where,<br />
Still standing for some false, impossible shore.<br />
And sterner comes the roar<br />

<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;70</span>Fainter and fainter wreck and helmsman loom<br />

Thought I: "Above her state this spirit towers;<br />

Of sharers in a common human fate.<br /><br />

"She turns from that cold succour, which attends<br />

<h3><i class="indent4">April</i>, 1850</h3>
<p class="indent4">
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;°<a href="#1m">1</a></span>Goethe in Weimar sleeps,° and Greece,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;°<a href="#2m">2</a></span>Long since, saw Byron's° struggle cease.<br />
But one such death remain'd to come;<br />
The last poetic voice is dumb&mdash;<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5</span>We stand to-day by Wordsworth's tomb.<br /><br />

When Byron's eyes were shut in death,<br />
We bow'd our head and held our breath.<br />
He taught us little; but our soul<br />
Had <i class="indent4">felt</i> him like the thunder's roll.<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;10</span>With shivering heart the strife we saw<br />
Of passion with eternal law;<br />
And yet with reverential awe<br />
We watch'd the fount of fiery life<br />
Which served for that Titanic strife.<br /><br />

<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;15</span>When Goethe's death was told, we said:<br />
Sunk, then, is Europe's sagest head.<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#17m">17</a></span>Physician of the iron age,°<br />
Goethe has done his pilgrimage.<br />
He took the suffering human race,<br /><span class="left">[p.122]</span>
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;20</span>He read each wound, each weakness clear;<br />
And struck his finger on the place,<br />
And said: <i class="indent4">Thou ailest here, and here!</i><br />
He look'd on Europe's dying hour<br />
Of fitful dream and feverish power;<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;25</span>His eye plunged down the weltering strife,<br />
The turmoil of expiring life&mdash;<br />
He said: <i class="indent4">The end is everywhere,<br />
Art still has truth, take refuge there!</i><br />
And he was happy, if to know<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;30</span>Causes of things, and far below<br />
His feet to see the lurid flow<br />
Of terror, and insane distress,<br />
And headlong fate, be happiness.<br /><br />

And Wordsworth!&mdash;Ah, pale ghosts, rejoice!<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;35</span>For never has such soothing voice<br />
Been to your shadowy world convey'd,<br />
Since erst, at morn, some wandering shade<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#38m">38</a></span>Heard the clear song of Orpheus° come<br />
Through Hades, and the mournful gloom.<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;40</span>Wordsworth has gone from us&mdash;and ye,<br />
Ah, may ye feel his voice as we!<br />
He too upon a wintry clime<br />
Had fallen&mdash;on this iron time<br />
Of doubts, disputes, distractions, fears.<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;45</span>He found us when the age had bound<br />
Our souls in its benumbing round;<br />
He spoke, and loosed our heart in tears.<br />
He laid us as we lay at birth<br />
On the cool flowery lap of earth,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;50</span>Smiles broke from us and we had ease;<br />
The hills were round us, and the breeze<br /><span class="left">[p.123]</span>
Went o'er the sun-lit fields again;<br />
Our foreheads felt the wind and rain.<br />
Our youth returned; for there was shed<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;55</span>On spirits that had long been dead,<br />
Spirits dried up and closely furl'd,<br />
The freshness of the early world.<br /><br />

Ah! since dark days still bring to light<br />
Man's prudence and man's fiery might,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;60</span>Time may restore us in his course<br />
Goethe's sage mind and Byron's force;<br />
But where will Europe's latter hour<br />
Again find Wordsworth's healing power?<br />
Others will teach us how to dare,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;65</span>And against fear our breast to steel;<br />
Others will strengthen us to bear&mdash;<br />
But who, ah! who, will make us feel<br />
The cloud of mortal destiny?<br />
Others will front it fearlessly&mdash;<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;70</span>But who, like him, will put it by?<br /><br />

Keep fresh the grass upon his grave<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#72m">72</a></span>O Rotha,° with thy living wave!<br />
Sing him thy best! for few or none<br />
Hears thy voice right, now he is gone.</p>

Go, for they call you, shepherd, from the hill;<br />
  <span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;°<a href="#2sg">2</a></span>Go, shepherd, and untie the wattled cotes°!<br />
    No longer leave thy wistful flock unfed,<br /><span class="left">[p.124]</span>
Nor let thy bawling fellows rack their throats,<br />
  <span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5</span>Nor the cropp'd herbage shoot another head.<br />
    But when the fields are still,<br />
And the tired men and dogs all gone to rest,<br />

  <span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;°<a href="#9sg">9</a></span>Cross and recross° the strips of moon-blanch'd green,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;10</span>Come, shepherd, and again begin the quest!<br /><br />

Here, where the reaper was at work of late&mdash;<br />
  In this high field's dark corner, where he leaves<br />
    <span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#13sg">13</a></span>His coat, his basket, and his earthen cruse,°<br />
  And in the sun all morning binds the sheaves,<br />
    <span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;15</span>Then here, at noon, comes back his stores to use&mdash;<br />
      Here will I sit and wait,<br />
  While to my ear from uplands far away<br />
    The bleating of the folded flocks is borne,<br />
    <span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#19sg">19</a></span>With distant cries of reapers in the corn°&mdash;<br />
  <span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;20</span>All the live murmur of a summer's day.<br /><br />

Screen'd is this nook o'er the high, half-reap'd field,<br />
  And here till sun-down, shepherd! will I be.<br />
    Through the thick corn the scarlet poppies peep,<br />
  And round green roots and yellowing stalks I see<br />
    <span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;25</span>Pale pink convolvulus in tendrils creep;<br />
      And air-swept lindens yield<br />
  Their scent, and rustle down their perfumed showers<br />
    Of bloom on the bent grass where I am laid,<br />
    And bower me from the August sun with shade;<br />
  <span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#30sg">30</a></span>And the eye travels down to Oxford's towers.°<br /><br />

<span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#31sg">31</a></span>And near me on the grass lies Glanvil's book°&mdash;<br />
  Come, let me read the oft-read tale again!<br />
    The story of the Oxford scholar poor,<br /><span class="left">[p.125]</span>
  Of pregnant parts and quick inventive brain,<br />
    <span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;35</span>Who, tired of knocking at preferment's door,<br />
      One summer-morn forsook<br />
  His friends, and went to learn the gipsy-lore,<br />
    And roam'd the world with that wild brotherhood,<br />
    And came, as most men deem'd, to little good,<br />
  <span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;40</span>But came to Oxford and his friends no more.<br /><br />

But once, years after, in the country-lanes,<br />
  <span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#42sg">42</a></span>Two scholars, whom at college erst° he knew,<br />
    Met him, and of his way of life enquired;<br />
  Whereat he answer'd, that the gipsy-crew,<br />
    <span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;45</span>His mates, had arts to rule as they desired<br />
      The workings of men's brains,<br />
And they can bind them to what thoughts they will.<br />
  "And I," he said, "the secret of their art,<br />
  When fully learn'd, will to the world impart;<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#50sg">50</a></span>But it needs heaven-sent moments for this skill.°"<br /><br />

This said, he left them, and return'd no more.&mdash;<br />
  But rumours hung about the country-side,<br />
    That the lost Scholar long was seen to stray,<br />
  Seen by rare glimpses, pensive and tongue-tied,<br />
    <span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;55</span>In hat of antique shape, and cloak of grey,<br />
      The same the gipsies wore.<br />
  <span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#57sg">57</a></span>Shepherds had met him on the Hurst° in spring;<br />
    <span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#58sg">58</a></span>At some lone alehouse in the Berkshire moors,°<br />
    On the warm ingle-bench, the smock-frock'd boors<br />
  <span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;60</span>Had found him seated at their entering.<br /><br />

But, 'mid their drink and clatter, he would fly.<br />
  And I myself seem half to know, thy looks,<br />
    And put the shepherds, wanderer! on thy trace;<br /><span class="left">[p.126]</span>
  And boys who in lone wheatfields scare the rooks<br />
    <span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;65</span>I ask if thou hast pass'd their quiet place;<br />
      Or in my boat I lie<br />
  Moor'd to the cool bank in the summer-heats,<br />
    'Mid wide grass meadows which the sunshine fills.<br />
    <span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#69sg">69</a></span>And watch the warm, green-muffled° Cumner hills,<br />
  <span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;70</span>And wonder if thou haunt'st their shy retreats.<br /><br />

For most, I know, thou lov'st retired ground!<br />
  Thee at the ferry Oxford riders blithe,<br />
    Returning home on summer-nights, have met<br />
  <span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#74sg">74</a></span>Crossing the stripling Thames at Bab-lock-hithe,°<br />
    <span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;75</span>Trailing in the cool stream thy fingers wet,<br />
      As the punt's rope chops round;<br />
  And leaning backward in a pensive dream,<br />
    And fostering in thy lap a heap of flowers<br />
    Pluck'd in shy fields and distant Wychwood bowers<br />
  <span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;80</span>And thine eyes resting on the moonlit stream.<br /><br />

And then they land, and thou art seen no more!&mdash;<br />
  Maidens, who from the distant hamlets come;<br />
    <span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#83sg">83</a></span>To dance around the Fyfield elm in May,°<br />
  Oft through the darkening fields have seen thee roam<br />
    Or cross a stile into the public way.<br />
      <span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;85</span>Oft thou hast given them store<br />
  Of flowers&mdash;the frail-leaf'd, white anemony,<br />
    Dark bluebells drench'd with dews of summer eves<br />
    And purple orchises with spotted leaves&mdash;<br />
  <span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;90</span>But none hath words she can report of thee.<br /><br />

<span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#91sg">91</a></span>And, above Godstow Bridge,° when hay-time's here<br />
  In June, and many a scythe in sunshine flames,<br />
    Men who through those wide fields of breezy grass<br /><span class="left">[p.127]</span>
  Where black-wing'd swallows haunt the glittering Thames,<br />
    <span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#95sg">95</a></span>To bathe in the abandon'd lasher pass,°<br />
      Have often pass'd thee near<br />
  Sitting upon the river bank o'ergrown;<br />
    <span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#98sg">98</a></span>Mark'd thine outlandish° garb, thy figure spare,<br />
    Thy dark vague eyes, and soft abstracted air&mdash;<br />
  <span class="right">&nbsp;100</span>But, when they came from bathing, thou wast gone!<br /><br />

At some lone homestead in the Cumner hills,<br />
  Where at her open door the housewife darns,<br />
    Thou hast been seen, or hanging on a gate<br />
  To watch the threshers in the mossy barns.<br />
    <span class="right">&nbsp;105</span>Children, who early range these slopes and late<br />
      For cresses from the rills,<br />
  Have known thee eying, all an April-day,<br />
    The springing pastures and the feeding kine;<br />
    And mark'd thee, when the stars come out and shine,<br />
  <span class="right">&nbsp;110</span>Through the long dewy grass move slow away.<br /><br />

<span class="right">°<a href="#111sg">111</a></span>In autumn, on the skirts of Bagley Wood°&mdash;<br />
  Where most the gipsies by the turf-edged way<br />
    Pitch their smoked tents, and every bush you see<br />

   <span class="right">°<a href="#115sg">115</a></span> Above the forest-ground called Thessaly°&mdash;<br />
      The blackbird, picking food,<br />
  Sees thee, nor stops his meal, nor fears at all;<br />
    So often has he known thee past him stray<br />
    Rapt, twirling in thy hand a wither'd spray,<br />
  <span class="right">&nbsp;120</span>And waiting for the spark from heaven to fall.<br /><br />

And once, in winter, on the causeway chill<br />
  Where home through flooded fields foot-travellers go,<br /><span class="left">[p.128]</span>
    Have I not pass'd thee on the wooden bridge,<br />
  Wrapt in thy cloak and battling with the snow,<br />
    <span class="right">°<a href="#125sg">125</a></span>Thy face tow'rd Hinksey° and its wintry ridge?<br />
      And thou hast climb'd the hill,<br />
  And gain'd the white brow of the Cumner range;<br />
    Turn'd once to watch, while thick the snowflakes fall<br />
    <span class="right">°<a href="#129sg">129</a></span>The line of festal light in Christ-Church hall°&mdash;<br />
  <span class="right">°<a href="#130sg">130</a></span>Then sought thy straw in some sequester'd grange.<br /><br />

But what&mdash;-I dream! Two hundred years are flown<br />
  Since first thy story ran through Oxford halls,<br />
    <span class="right">°<a href="#133sg">133</a></span>And the grave Glanvil° did the tale inscribe<br />
  That thou wert wander'd from the studious walls<br />
    <span class="right">&nbsp;135</span>To learn strange arts, and join a gipsy-tribe;<br />
      And thou from earth art gone<br />
  Long since, and in some quiet churchyard laid&mdash;<br />
    Some country-nook, where o'er thy unknown grave<br />
    Tall grasses and white-flowering nettles wave<br />
  <span class="right">°<a href="#140sg">140</a></span>Under a dark red-fruited yew-tree's° shade.<br /><br />

&mdash;No, no, thou hast not felt the lapse of hours!<br />
  For what wears out the life of mortal men?<br />
    'Tis that from change to change their being rolls<br />
  'Tis that repeated shocks, again, again,<br />
    <span class="right">&nbsp;145</span>Exhaust the energy of strongest souls<br />
      And numb the elastic powers.<br />
  <span class="right">°<a href="#147sg">147</a></span>Till having used our nerves with bliss and teen,°<br />
    And tired upon a thousand schemes our wit,<br />
    <span class="right">°<a href="#149sg">149</a></span>To the just-pausing Genius° we remit<br />
  <span class="right">&nbsp;150</span>Our worn-out life, and are&mdash;what we have been.<br /><br />

<span class="right">°<a href="#151sg">151</a></span>Thou hast not lived,° why should'st thou perish, so?<br />

    Else wert thou long since number'd with the dead!<br />
  Else hadst thou spent, like other men, thy fire!<br />
    <span class="right">&nbsp;155</span>The generations of thy peers are fled,<br />
      And we ourselves shall go;<br />

  <span class="right">°<a href="#160sg">160</a></span>Because thou hadst&mdash;what we, alas! have not.°<br /><br />

For early didst thou leave the world, with powers<br />
  Fresh, undiverted to the world without,<br />
    Firm to their mark, not spent on other things;<br />
  Free from the sick fatigue, the languid doubt,<br />
   <span class="right">°<a href="#165sg">165</a></span> Which much to have tried, in much been baffled, brings.°<br />
      O life unlike to ours!<br />

    And each half lives a hundred different lives;<br />
  <span class="right">°<a href="#170sg">170</a></span>Who wait like thee, but not, like thee, in hope.°<br /><br />

Thou waitest for the spark from heaven! and we,<br />

    Who never deeply felt, nor clearly will'd,<br />
  Whose insight never has borne fruit in deeds,<br />
    <span class="right">&nbsp;175</span>Whose vague resolves never have been fulfill'd;<br />
      For whom each year we see<br />

 <span class="right">°<a href="#180sg">180</a></span>Ah! do not we, wanderer! await it too°<br /><br />

Yes, we await it!&mdash;but it still delays,<br />

    Who most has suffer'd, takes dejectedly<br />
  His seat upon the intellectual throne;<br />
    <span class="right">&nbsp;185</span>And all his store of sad experience he	<br />
      Lays bare of wretched days;<br />

    And how the breast was soothed, and how the head,<br />
  <span class="right">°<a href="#190sg">190</a></span>And all his hourly varied anodynes.°<br /><br />

This for our wisest! and we others pine,<br />

O born in days when wits were fresh and clear,<br />

    Before this strange disease of modern life,<br />
  With its sick hurry, its divided aims,<br />
    <span class="right">&nbsp;205</span>Its head o'ertax'd, its palsied hearts, was rife&mdash;<br />

    From her false friend's approach in Hades turn,<br />

      Soon, soon thy cheer would die,<br />

  <span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;10</span>Thyrsis and I; we still had Thyrsis then.<br /><br />

Runs it not here, the track by Childsworth Farm,<br />
  Past the high wood, to where the elm-tree crowns<br />
    The hill behind whose ridge the sunset flames<br />
  <span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#14th">14</a></span>The signal-elm, that looks on Ilsley Downs°?<br />
    <span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#15th">15</a></span>The Vale,° the three lone weirs,° the youthful Thames?&mdash;,<br />
      This winter-eve is warm,<br />
  Humid the air! leafless, yet soft as spring,<br />
    The tender purple spray on copse and briers!<br />
    <span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#19th">19</a></span>And that sweet city with her dreaming spires,°<br />
  <span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#20th">20</a></span>She needs not June for beauty's heightening,°<br /><br />

Lovely all times she lies, lovely to-night!&mdash;<br />
  Only, methinks, some loss of habit's power<br />
    <span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#23th">23</a></span>Befalls me wandering through this upland dim,°<br />
  <span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#24th">24</a></span>Once pass'd I blindfold here, at any hour°;<br />
    <span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;25</span>Now seldom come I, since I came with him.<br />
      That single elm-tree bright<br />
  Against the west&mdash;I miss it! is it gone?<br />
    We prized it dearly; while it stood, we said,<br />
    Our friend, the Gipsy-Scholar, was not dead;<br />
  <span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#30th">30</a></span>While the tree lived, he in these fields lived on.°<br /><br />

Too rare, too rare, grow now my visits here,<br />
  But once I knew each field, each flower, each stick;<br />
    And with the country-folk acquaintance made<br />
  By barn in threshing-time, by new-built rick.<br />
    <span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#40th">35</a></span>Here, too, our shepherd-pipes° we first assay'd.<br />
      Ah me! this many a year<br />
  My pipe is lost, my shepherd's holiday!<br />
    Needs must I lose them, needs with heavy heart<br />
    Into the world and wave of men depart;<br />
  <span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#40th">40</a></span>But Thyrsis of his own will went away.°<br /><br />

<span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#45th">41</a></span>It irk'd° him to be here, he could not rest.<br />
  He loved each simple joy the country yields,<br />
    <span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#45th">43</a></span>He loved his mates; but yet he could not keep,°<br />
For that a shadow lour'd on the fields,<br />
  <span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#45th">45</a></span>Here with the shepherds and the silly° sheep.<br />
    Some life of men unblest<br />
He knew, which made him droop, and fill'd his head.<br />
  He went; his piping took a troubled sound<br />
  Of storms° that rage outside our happy ground;<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#50th">50</a></span>He could not wait their passing, he is dead.°<br /><br />

So, some tempestuous morn in early June,<br />
  When the year's primal burst of bloom is o'er,<br />
    Before the roses and the longest day&mdash;<br />
  When garden-walks and all the grassy floor<br />
    <span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#60th">55</a></span>With blossoms red and white of fallen May°<br />
      And chestnut-flowers are strewn&mdash;<br />
  So have I heard the cuckoo's parting cry,<br />
    From the wet field, through the vext garden-trees,<br />
    Come with the volleying rain and tossing breeze:<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#60th">60</a></span><i class="indent4">The bloom is gone, and with the bloom go I°!</i><br /><br />

Too quick despairer, wherefore wilt thou go?<br />
  <span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#62th">62</a></span>Soon will the high Midsummer pomps° come on,<br />
    Soon will the musk carnations break and swell,<br />
  Soon shall we have gold-dusted snapdragon,<br />
    <span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;65</span>Sweet-William with his homely cottage-smell,<br />
      And stocks in fragrant blow;<br />
  Roses that down the alleys shine afar,<br />
    And open, jasmine-muffled lattices,<br />
    And groups under the dreaming garden-trees,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;70</span>And the full moon, and the white evening-star.<br /><br />

<span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#71th">71</a></span>He hearkens not! light comer,° he is flown!<br />
  What matters it? next year he will return,<br />
    And we shall have him in the sweet spring-days.<br />
With whitening hedges, and uncrumpling fern,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;75</span>And blue-bells trembling by the forest-ways,<br />
And scent of hay new-mown.<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#77th">77</a></span>But Thyrsis never more we swains° shall see;<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#78th">78</a></span>See him come back, and cut a smoother reed,°<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#79th">79</a></span>And blow a strain the world at last shall heed°&mdash;<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#80th">80</a></span>For Time, not Corydon,° hath conquer'd thee!<br /><br />

Alack, for Corydon no rival now!&mdash;<br />
But when Sicilian shepherds lost a mate,<br />
Some good survivor with his flute would go,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#84th">84</a></span>Piping a ditty sad for Bion's fate°;<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#85th">85</a></span>And cross the unpermitted ferry's flow,°<br />
And relax Pluto's brow,<br />
And make leap up with joy the beauteous head<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#88th">88</a></span>Of Proserpine,° among whose crowned hair<br />
Are flowers first open'd on Sicilian air,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#90th">90</a></span>And flute his friend, like Orpheus, from the dead.°<br /><br />

O easy access to the hearer's grace<br />
When Dorian shepherds sang to Proserpine!<br />
For she herself had trod Sicilian fields,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#94th">94</a></span>She knew the Dorian water's gush divine,°<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;95</span>She knew each lily white which Enna yields,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#96th">96</a></span>Each rose with blushing face°;<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;°<a href="#97th">97</a></span>She loved the Dorian pipe, the Dorian strain.°<br />
But ah, of our poor Thames she never heard!<br />
Her foot the Cumner cowslips never stirr'd;<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;100</span>And we should tease her with our plaint in vain!<br /><br />

Well! wind-dispersed and vain the words will be,<br />
Yet, Thyrsis, let me give my grief its hour<br />
In the old haunt, and find our tree-topp'd hill!<br />
  Who, if not I, for questing here hath power?<br />
    <span class="right">&nbsp;105</span>I know the wood which hides the daffodil,<br />
      <span class="right">°<a href="#106th">106</a></span>I know the Fyfield tree,°<br />
  I know what white, what purple fritillaries<br />
    The grassy harvest of the river-fields,<br />
    <span class="right">°<a href="#109th">109</a></span>Above by Ensham,° down by Sandford,° yields,<br />
  <span class="right">&nbsp;110</span>And what sedged brooks are Thames's tributaries;<br /><br />

I know these slopes; who knows them if not I?&mdash;<br />
  But many a dingle on the loved hill-side,<br />
    With thorns once studded, old, white-blossom'd trees<br />
  Where thick the cowslips grew, and far descried<br />
    <span class="right">&nbsp;115</span>High tower'd the spikes of purple orchises,<br />
      Hath since our day put by<br />
  The coronals of that forgotten time;<br />
    Down each green bank hath gone the ploughboy's team,<br />
    And only in the hidden brookside gleam<br />
  <span class="right">&nbsp;120</span>Primroses, orphans of the flowery prime.<br /><br />

Where is the girl, who by the boatman's door,<br />
  Above the locks, above the boating throng,<br />
    <span class="right">°<a href="#123th">123</a></span>Unmoor'd our skiff when through the Wytham flats,°<br />
  Red loosestrife and blond meadow-sweet among<br />
    <span class="right">&nbsp;125</span>And darting swallows and light water-gnats,<br />
      We track'd the shy Thames shore?<br />
  Where are the mowers, who, as the tiny swell<br />
    Of our boat passing heaved the river-grass,<br />
    Stood with suspended scythe to see us pass?&mdash;<br />
  <span class="right">&nbsp;130</span>They all are gone, and thou art gone as well!<br /><br />

Yes, thou art gone! and round me too the night<br />
  In ever-nearing circle weaves her shade.<br />
    I see her veil draw soft across the day,<br />
I feel her slowly chilling breath invade<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#135th">135</a></span>The cheek grown thin, the brown hair sprent° with grey; <br />
I feel her finger light<br />
Laid pausefully upon life's headlong train;&mdash;<br />
The foot less prompt to meet the morning dew,<br />
The heart less bounding at emotion new,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;140</span>And hope, once crush'd, less quick to spring again.<br /><br />

And long the way appears, which seem'd so short<br />
To the less practised eye of sanguine youth;<br />
And high the mountain-tops, in cloudy air,<br />
The mountain-tops where is the throne of Truth,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;145</span>Tops in life's morning-sun so bright and bare!<br />
Unbreachable the fort<br />
Of the long-batter'd world uplifts its wall;<br />
And strange and vain the earthly turmoil grows,<br />
And near and real the charm of thy repose,<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#150th">150</a></span>And night as welcome as a friend would fall.°<br /><br />

But hush! the upland hath a sudden loss<br />
Of quiet!&mdash;Look, adown the dusk hill-side,<br />
A troop of Oxford hunters going home,<br />
As in old days, jovial and talking, ride!<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#155th">155</a></span>From hunting with the Berkshire° hounds they come.<br />
Quick! let me fly, and cross<br />
Into yon farther field!&mdash;'Tis done; and see,<br />
Back'd by the sunset, which doth glorify<br />
The orange and pale violet evening-sky,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;160</span>Bare on its lonely ridge, the Tree! the Tree!<br /><br />

I take the omen! Eve lets down her veil,<br />
The white fog creeps from bush to bush about,<br />
The west unflushes, the high stars grow bright,<br />
And in the scatter'd farms the lights come out.<br />
  <span class="right">&nbsp;165</span>I cannot reach the signal-tree to-night,<br />
    Yet, happy omen, hail!<br />
<span class="right">°<a href="#167th">167</a></span>Hear it from thy broad lucent Arno-vale°<br />
  (For there thine earth-forgetting eyelids keep<br />
  The morningless and unawakening sleep<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;170</span>Under the flowery oleanders pale),<br /><br />

Hear it, O Thyrsis, still our tree is there!&mdash;<br />
  Ah, vain! These English fields, this upland dim,<br />
    These brambles pale with mist engarlanded,<br />
  That lone, sky-pointing tree, are not for him;<br />
    <span class="right">°<a href="#175th">175</a></span>To a boon southern country he is fled,°<br />
      And now in happier air,<br />
  <span class="right">°<a href="#177th">177</a></span>Wandering with the great Mother's° train divine<br />

Thou hearest the immortal chants of old!&mdash;<br />
  Putting his sickle to the perilous grain<br />
    In the hot cornfield of the Phrygian king,<br />
  For thee the Lityerses-song again<br />
    <span class="right">&nbsp;185</span>Young Daphnis with his silver voice doth sing;<br />
  Sings his Sicilian fold,<br />
    His sheep, his hapless love, his blinded eyes&mdash;<br />
  And how a call celestial round him rang,<br />
    And heavenward from the fountain-brink he sprang<br />
  <span class="right">°<a href="#190th">190</a></span>And all the marvel of the golden skies.°<br /><br />

There thou art gone, and me thou leavest here<br />
  <span class="right">°<a href="#200th">192</a></span>Sole° in these fields! yet will I not despair.<br />
    Despair I will not, while I yet descry<br />
  'Neath the mild canopy of English air<br />
    <span class="right">&nbsp;195</span>That lonely tree against the western sky.<br />
      Still, still these slopes, 'tis clear,<br />

    <span class="right">°<a href="#200th">198</a></span>Fields where soft sheep° from cages pull the hay,<br />
    Woods with anemonies in flower till May,<br />
  <span class="right">°<a href="#200th">200</a></span>Know him a wanderer still; then why not me?°<br /><br />

A fugitive and gracious light he seeks,<br />
  <span class="right">°<a href="#202th">202</a></span>Shy to illumin; and I seek it too.°<br />
    This does not come with houses or with gold,<br />
  With place, with honour, and a flattering crew;<br />
    <span class="right">&nbsp;205</span>'Tis not in the world's market bought and sold&mdash;<br />
      But the smooth-slipping weeks<br />
  Drop by, and leave its seeker still untired;<br />
    Out of the heed of mortals he is gone,<br />
    He wends unfollow'd, he must house alone;<br />
  <span class="right">&nbsp;210</span>Yet on he fares, by his own heart inspired.<br /><br />

Thou too, O Thyrsis, on like quest was bound;<br />
  Thou wanderedst with me for a little hour!<br />
    Men gave thee nothing; but this happy quest,<br />
  If men esteem'd thee feeble, gave thee power,<br />
    <span class="right">&nbsp;215</span>If men procured thee trouble, gave thee rest.<br />
      And this rude Cumner ground,<br />
  Its fir-topped Hurst, its farms, its quiet fields,<br />
    Here cam'st thou in thy jocund youthful time,<br />
    Here was thine height of strength, thy golden prime!<br />
  <span class="right">&nbsp;220</span>And still the haunt beloved a virtue yields.<br /><br />

What though the music of thy rustic flute<br />
  Kept not for long its happy, country tone;<br />
    Lost it too soon, and learnt a stormy note<br />
  Of men contention-tost, of men who groan,<br />
       <span class="right">&nbsp;225</span>Which task'd thy pipe too sore, and tired thy throat&mdash;<br />
            It fail'd, and thou wast mute!<br />
  Yet hadst thou alway visions of our light,<br />
       And long with men of care thou couldst not stay,<br />
       And soon thy foot resumed its wandering way,<br />
  <span class="right">&nbsp;230</span>Left human haunt, and on alone till night.<br /><br />

Too rare, too rare, grow now my visits here!<br />
  'Mid city-noise, not, as with thee of yore,<br />
       Thyrsis! in reach of sheep-bells is my home.<br />
  Then through the great town's harsh, heart-wearying roar,<br />
       <span class="right">&nbsp;235</span>Let in thy voice a whisper often come,<br />
            To chase fatigue and fear:<br />
  <i class="indent4">Why faintest thou? I wandered till I died.<br />

The autumn-evening. The field<br />
Strewn with its dank yellow drifts<br />

Fifteen years have gone round<br />

Chatter and love and hate,<br />

Nothing; and then they die&mdash;<br />
Perish;&mdash;and no one asks<br />
Who or what they have been,<br />
More than he asks what waves,<br />
<span class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;70</span>In the moonlit solitudes mild<br />
Of the midmost Ocean, have swell'd,<br />
Foam'd for a moment, and gone.<br /><br />

Not without aim to go round<br />

On&mdash;and at nightfall at last<br />
Come to the end of our way,<br />

Stands on the threshold, the wind<br />
Shaking his thin white hairs&mdash;<br />
Holds his lantern to scan<br />
Our storm-beat figures, and asks:<br />

Whom we have left in the snow?<br /><br />

Sadly we answer: We bring<br />
Only ourselves! we lost<br />
Sight of the rest in the storm.<br />

Fearful, and we in our march<br />

<h3><a href="#SOHRAB">SOHRAB AND RUSTUM</a>°</h3>
<p>
"I am occupied with a thing that gives me more pleasure than
anything I have ever done yet, which is a good sign, but whether I
shall not ultimately spoil it by being obliged to strike it off in fragments
instead of at one heat, I cannot quite say." (Arnold, in a
letter to Mrs. Foster, April, 1853.)</p>
<p>
"All my spare time has been spent on a poem which I have just
finished and which I think by far the best thing I have yet done,
and I think it will be generally liked; though one can never be
sure of this. I have had the greatest pleasure in composing it, a
rare thing with me, and, as I think, a good test of the pleasure
what you write is likely to afford to others. But the story is a
very noble and excellent one." (Arnold, in a letter to his mother,
May, 1853.)</p>
<p>
The following synopsis of the story of Sohrab and Rustum the
"tale replete with tears," is gathered from several sources, chiefly
Benjamin's <i>Persia</i>, in <i>The Story of the Nations</i>, Sir John Malcolm's
<i>History of Persia</i>, and the great Persian epic poem, <i>Shah Nameh</i>.
The <i>Shah Nameh</i> the original source of the story, and which purports
to narrate the exploits of Persia's kings and champions over
a space of thirty-six centuries, bears the same relation to Persian
literature as the <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i> to the Greek, and the <i>Aeneid</i> to
the Latin, though in structure it more nearly resembles <i>Morte d'Arthur</i>, 		  <span class="left">[p.150]</span>
which records in order the achievements of various heroes.
In it the native poet Mansur ibn Ahmad, afterwards known to
literature as Firdausi, the Paradisaical, has set down the early
tales and traditions of his people with all the vividness and color
common to oriental writers. The principal hero of the poem is the
mighty Rustum, who, mounted on his famous horse Ruksh, performed
prodigies of valor in defence of the Persian throne. Of all
his adventures his encounter with Sohrab is the most dramatic.
The poem was probably written in the latter half of the tenth
century. As will be seen, the incidents narrated in Arnold's poem
form but an episode in the complete story of the two champions.</p>
<p>
Rustum (or Rustem), having killed a wild ass while hunting on
the Turanian frontier, and having feasted on its flesh, composed
himself to sleep, leaving his faithful steed, Ruksh (or Raksh), to
graze untethered. On awakening, he found his horse had disappeared,
and believing it had been stolen, the warrior proceeded
towards Semenjan, a near-by city, in hopes of recovering his property.
On the way, he learned that Ruksh had been found by the
servants of the king and was stabled at Semenjan, as he had surmised.
Upon Rustum's demand, the steed was promptly restored
to him, and he was about to depart when he was prevailed upon to
accept the king's invitation to tarry awhile and rest himself in
feasting and idleness.</p>
<p>
Now the king of Semenjan had a fair daughter named Tahmineh,
who had become enamoured of Rustum because of his mighty
exploits. Susceptible as she was beautiful, she made her attachment
so evident that the young hero, who was as ardent as he was
brave, readily yielded to the power of her fascination. The consent
of the king having been obtained, Rustum and Tahmineh were
married with all the rites prescribed by the laws of the country.
A peculiar feature of this alliance lay in the fact that the king of
Semenjan was feudatory to Afrasiab, the deadly enemy of Persia,
while Rustum was her greatest champion. At this time, however, 	  	  		<span class="left"><a name="p.151">[p.151]</a></span>
the two countries were at peace.</p>
<p>
For a time all went happily, then Rustum found it necessary to
leave his bride, as he thought, for only a short time. At parting
he gave her an onyx, which he wore on his arm, bidding her, if a
daughter should be born to their union, to twine the gem in her hair
under a fortunate star; but if a son, to bind it on his arm, and he
would be insured a glorious career. Rustum then mounted Ruksh
and rode away&mdash;as time proved, never to return.</p>
<p>
The months went by, and to the lonely bride was born a marvellous
son, whom, because of his comely features, she named
Sohrab. Fearing Rustum would send for the boy when he grew
older, and thus rob her of her treasure, Tahmineh sent word to
him that the child was a girl&mdash;"no son," and Rustum took no
further interest in it.</p>
<p>
While still of tender years, Sohrab showed signs of his noble
lineage. He early displayed a love for horses, and at the age of
ten years, according to the tradition, was large and handsome and
highly accomplished in the use of arms. Realizing at length that
he was of lofty descent, he insisted that his mother, who had concealed
the fact, should inform him of the name of his father. Being
told that it was the renowned Rustum, he exclaimed, "Since he is
my father, I shall go to his aid; he shall become king of Persia
and together we shall rule the world." After this the youth caused
a horse worthy of him to be found, and with the aid of his grandfather,
the king of Semenjan, he prepared to go on the quest,
attended by a mighty host.</p>
<p>
When Afrasiab, the Turanian ruler, learned that Sohrab was
going to war with the Persians, he was greatly pleased, and after
counselling with his wise men, decided openly to assist him in his
enterprises, with the expectation that both Rustum and Sohrab
would fall in battle and Persia be at his mercy. He accordingly
sent an army of auxiliaries to Sohrab, accompanied by two astute  	   		<span class="left">[p.152]</span>
courtiers, Houman and Barman, who, under the guise of friendship,
were to act as counsellors to the young leader. These he
ordered to keep the knowledge of their relationship from father
and son and to seek to bring about an encounter between them,
in the hope that Sohrab would slay Rustum, Afrasiab's most
dreaded foeman, after which the unsuspecting youth might easily
be disposed of by treachery.</p>
<p>
Sohrab, with his army and that of Afrasiab, set out, intending to
fight his way until Rustum should be sent against him, when he
would reveal himself to his father and form an alliance with him
that would place the line of Seistan on the throne. On the way
southward, Sohrab overthrew and captured the Persian champion,
Hujir, and the same day conquered the warrior maiden Gurdafrid,
whose beauty and tears, however, prevailed upon him to release
her. Guzdehern, father of Gurdafrid, recognizing Sohrab's prowess,
and alarmed for the safety of the Persian throne, secretly despatched
a courier to the king Kai Kaoos to warn him of the young
Tartar's approach. Kaoos, in great terror, sent for Rustum to
hurry to his aid. Regardless of the king's request, Rustum spent
eight days in feasting, then presented himself at the court. Kaoos,
angered at the delay, ordered both the champion and the messenger
to be executed forthwith; but Rustum effected his escape on
Ruksh, and returned to Seistan, leaving Persia to her fate. The
king's wrath, however, soon gave place to fear; and recognizing
the danger of his throne unsupported by Rustum's valor, he despatched
messengers to him with humble petitions and apologies.
After much protesting, Rustum finally yielded and accompanied
the Persian army, under the king Kai Kaoos, which at once set
forth to encounter Sohrab.</p>
<p>
The morning before the opening of hostilities, Sohrab, taking the
Persian Hujir, whom he still held a prisoner, to the top of a rocky
eminence, ordered him to point out the tents of the chief warriors 	  			<span class="left">[p.153]</span>
of the Persian army, particularly Rustum's. But Hujir, fearing
lest Sohrab should attack Rustum unexpectedly and so overcome
him, declared that the great chieftain's tent was not among those
on the plain below. Disappointed at his failure to find his father,
Sohrab led his army in a fierce onslaught on the Persians, driving
them in confusion before him. In this dire extremity Kai Kaoos
sent for Rustum, who was somewhat apart from the main troop.
Exclaiming that the king never sent for him except when he had
got himself into trouble, the warrior armed, mounted Ruksh, and
rushed to the combat. By mutual consent the two champions withdrew
to a retired spot, where, unmolested, they might fight out
their quarrel hand to hand. As they approached each other,
Rustum, moved with compassion by the youth of his foe, tried to
dissuade Sohrab from his purpose, and counselled him to retire.
Sohrab, filled with sudden hope,&mdash;an instinctive feeling that the
father whom he was seeking stood before him,&mdash;eagerly demanded
whether this were Rustum. But Rustum, fearing treachery, said
he was only an ordinary man, having neither palace nor princely
kingdom&mdash;not Rustum.</p>
<p>
They marked off the lists, and, mounted on their powerful horses,
fought first with javelins, then with swords, clubs, and bows and
arrows. After several hours of fighting both were exhausted, and
by tacit consent they retired to opposite sides of the lists for rest.
When the combat was renewed, Sohrab gained a slight advantage.
A truce was then made for the night, and the warriors returned to
their tents to prepare for the morrow.</p>
<p>
With daybreak the struggle was renewed. To prevent the
armies from intervening or engaging in battle, they were removed
to a distance of several miles. Midway between, Sohrab and Rustum
met in the midst of a lonely, treeless waste. More convinced
than before that his adversary was Rustum, Sohrab sought to bring
about a reconciliation, but Rustum refused. This time they fought	  	   	  	<span class="left">[p.154]</span>
on foot. From morning till afternoon they fought, neither gaining
any decided advantage. At last Sohrab succeeded in felling Rustum
to the earth, and was about to slay him, when the Persian
called out that it was not the custom in chivalrous warfare to
slay a champion until he was thrown the second time. Sohrab,
generous as brave, released his prostrate foe; and again father and
son parted.</p>
<p>
Rustum, scarcely believing himself alive after such an escape,
purified himself with water, and prayed that his wounds might be
healed and his accustomed strength restored to him. Never before
had he been so beset in battle.</p>
<p>
With morning came the renewal of the combat, both champions
determining to end it that day. Late in the evening Rustum, by a
supreme effort, seized Sohrab around the waist and hurled him to
the ground. Then, fearing lest the youth prove too strong for him
in the end, he drew his blade and plunged it into Sohrab's bosom.</p>
<p>
Sohrab forgave Rustum, but warned him to beware the vengeance
of his father, the mighty Rustum, who must soon learn that
he had slain his son Sohrab. "I went out to seek my father,"
cried the dying youth, "for my mother had told me by what tokens
I should know him, and I perish for longing after him.... Yet
I say unto thee, if thou shouldst become a fish that swimmeth in
the depths of the ocean, if thou shouldst change into a star that is
concealed in the farthest heaven, my father would draw thee forth
from thy hiding-place, and avenge my death upon thee, when he
shall learn that the earth is become my bed. For my father is
Rustum the Pehliva, and it shall be told unto him, how that Sohrab
his son perished in the quest after his face." These words were as
death to the aged hero, who fell senseless at the side of his wounded
son. When he had recovered he called in despair for proofs of
what Sohrab had said. The now dying youth tore open his mail
and showed his father the onyx which his mother had bound on his	 	 			<span class="left">[p.155]</span>
arm as directed.</p>
<p>
The sight of his own signet rendered Rustum quite frantic; he
cursed himself, and would have put an end to his existence but for
the efforts of his expiring son. After Sohrab's death he burnt his
tents and carried the corpse to his father's home in Seistan, and
buried it there. The Tartar army, agreeable to Sohrab's last request,
was permitted to return home unmolested. When the tidings
of Sohrab's death reached his mother, she was inconsolable,
and died in less than a year.</p>
<p>
In the main the story as told by Arnold follows the original narrative.
A careful investigation of the alterations made, and the
effect thus produced, will lend added interest to the study of the
poem and give ample theme for composition work.</p>

<h3><a href="#BRANDAN">SAINT BRANDAN</a><a name="SAINT">°</a></h3><span class="left">[p.164]</span>
<p>
In this poem Arnold has vividly presented a quaint legend of
Judas Iscariot, popular in the Middle Ages. Saint Brandan (490-577)
was a celebrated Irish monk, famous for his voyages. "According
to the legendary accounts of his travels, he set sail with
others to seek the terrestrial paradise which was supposed to exist
in an island of the Atlantic. Various miracles are related of the
voyage, but they are always connected with the great island where
the monks are said to have landed. The legend was current in
the time of Columbus and long after, and many connected St.
Brandan's island with the newly discovered America. He is commemorated
on May 16."&mdash;<i>The Century Cyclopedia of Names</i>.</p>

<h3><a href="#FORSAKEN">THE FORSAKEN MERMAN</a><a name="MERMAN">°</a></h3>
<p>
"The title of this poem inevitably brings to mind Tennyson's
two poems, <i>The Merman</i> and <i>The Mermaid</i>. A comparison will
show that, in this instance at least, the Oxford poet has touched
his subject not less melodiously and with finer and deeper
feeling.&mdash;Margaret will not listen to her 'Children's voices, wild with
pain';&mdash;dearer to her is the selfish desire to save her own soul
than is the light in the eyes of her little Mermaiden, dearer than
the love of the king of the sea, who yearns for her with sorrow-laden
heart. Here is there an infinite tenderness and an infinite
tragedy."</p>
<p>
&mdash;L. DUPONT SYLE, <i>From Milton to Tennyson</i>.</p>
<p>
Legends of this kind abound among the sea-loving Gaelic and
Cymric people. Nowhere, perhaps, have they been given a more
pleasing and touching expression than in Arnold's poem. Note
carefully the dramatic manner in which the pathos of the story is
presented and developed.</p>

In his work on Matthew Arnold, George Saintsbury speaks of
this poem as follows: "It is, I believe, not so 'correct' as it
once was to admire this [poem]; but I confess indocility to
correctness, at least the correctness which varies with fashion. <i>The
Forsaken Merman</i> is not a perfect poem&mdash;it has <i>tongueurs</i>, though
it is not long; it has its inadequacies, those incompetences of
expression which are so oddly characteristic of its author; and his
elaborate simplicity, though more at home here than in some other
places, occasionally gives a dissonance. But it is a great poem,&mdash;one
by itself,&mdash;one which finds and keeps its own place in the fore-ordained
gallery or museum, with which every true lover of poetry
is provided, though he inherits it by degrees. None, I suppose,
will deny its pathos; I should be sorry for any one who fails to
perceive its beauty. The brief picture of the land, and the fuller
one of the sea, and that (more elaborate still) of the occupations
of the fugitive, all have their charm. But the triumph of the
piece is in one of those metrical coups, which give the triumph
of all the greatest poetry, in the sudden change from the slower
movements of the earlier stanzas, or strophes, to the quicker sweep
of the famous conclusions."</p>
<p>
What is the opening situation in the poem? Have the merman	  	   	   		<span class="left">[p.167]</span>
and his children just reached the shore, or have they been there
some time? Why so? Why does the merman still linger, when
he is convinced that further delay will count for nothing? Why
does he urge the children to call? What is shown by his repeated
question&mdash;"was it yesterday"? Tell the story of Margaret's
departure for the upper world, and discuss the validity of her
reason for going. Do you think she intended to return? What
is the significance of her smile just before departing? Give a
word picture of what the sea-folk saw as they lingered in the
churchyard. Will Margaret ever grieve for the past? If so,
when? Why? Who has your sympathy most, Margaret, the
forsaken merman, or the children? Why? Do you condemn
Margaret for the way she has done, or do you feel she was justified
in her actions? Discuss the versification, giving special attention
to its effect on the movement of the poem.</p>

<h3><a href="#ISEULT">TRISTRAM AND ISEULT</a><a name="TRISTRAM">°</a></h3>
<p>
The story of Tristram and Iseult is one of the most vivid and
passionate of the Arthurian cycle of legends, and is a favorite with
the poets. The following version is abridged from Dunlop's <i>History
of Fiction</i>.</p>
<p>
"In the court of his uncle, King Marc, the king of Cornwall,
who at this time resided at the castle of Tyntagel, Tristram became
expert in all knightly exercises.... The king of Ireland, at Tristram's
solicitation, promised to bestow his daughter Iseult in marriage
on King Marc.... The mother of Iseult gave to her
daughter's confidante a philtre, or love-potion, to be administered
on the night of her nuptials. Of this beverage Tristram and Iseult
unfortunately partook. Its influence, during the remainder of their
lives, regulated the affections and destiny of the lovers.</p>
<p>
"After the arrival of Tristram and Iseult in Cornwall, and the	   	   		<span class="left">[p.168]</span>
nuptials of the latter with King Marc, a great part of the romance
is occupied with their contrivances to procure secret interviews
... Tristram, being forced to leave Cornwall on account of the
displeasure of his uncle, repaired to Brittany, where lived Iseult
with the White Hands. He married her, more out of gratitude
than love. Afterwards he proceeded to the dominions of Arthur
which became the theatre of unnumbered exploits.</p>
<p>
"Tristram, subsequent to these events, returned to Brittany and
to his long-neglected wife. There, being wounded and sick, he was
soon reduced to the lowest ebb. In this situation he despatched a
confidant to the queen of Cornwall to try if he could induce her to
follow him to Brittany.</p>
<p>
"Meanwhile Tristram awaited the arrival of the queen with such
impatience that he employed one of his wife's damsels to watch at
the harbor. Through her, Iseult learned Tristram's secret, and
filled with jealousy, flew to her husband as the vessel which bore
the queen of Cornwall was wafted toward the harbor, and reported
that the sails were black (the signal that Iseult, Marc's queen, had
refused Tristram's request to come to him). Tristram, penetrated
with inexpressible grief, died. The account of Tristram's death
was the first intelligence which the queen of Cornwall heard on
landing. She was conducted to his chamber, and expired holding
him in her arms."</p>
<p>
<b><a name="1t">1.</a> Is she not come?</b> That is, Iseult of Ireland. Arnold's poem
takes up the story at the point where Tristram, now on his death-bed,
is watching eagerly for the coming of Iseult, Marc's queen, for
whom he had sent his confidant to Cornwall. Evidently he has
just awakened and is still somewhat confused; see l. 7. Surely
none will fail to appreciate so dramatic a situation.</p>

<h4><a href="#IRELAND">PART II</a><a name="II">°</a></h4>
<p>
With the opening of Part II the lovers are restored to each
other. The dying Tristram, worn with fever and impatient with
long waiting, unjustly charges Iseult with cruelty for not having
come to him with greater haste. Her gentle, loving words, however,
quickly dispel his doubts as to her loyalty to her former
vows. A complete reconciliation takes place, and they die in each
other's embrace. The picture of the Huntsman on the arras is one
of the most notable in English poetry.</p>

<p>
"Philomela unites the sensibilities and intellectual experience
of modern Englishmen with the luminousness and simplicity of
Greek poetry."&mdash;SAINTSBURY.</p>
<p>
The myth of the nightingale has long been a favorite with the
poets, who have variously interpreted the bird's song. See Coleridge's,
Keats's, and Wordsworth's poems on the subject. The
most common version of the myth, the one followed by Arnold,
is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>
"Pandion (son of Erichthonius, special ward to Minerva) had two
daughters, Procne and Philomela, of whom he gave the former in
marriage to Tereus, king of Thrace (or of Daulis in Phocis).
This ruler, after his wife had borne him a son, Itys (or Itylus),
wearied of her, plucked out her tongue by the roots to insure her
silence, and, pretending that she was dead, took in marriage the
other sister, Philomela. Procne, by means of a web, into which
she wove her story, informed Philomela of the horrible truth. In
revenge upon Tereus, the sisters killed Itylus, and served up the
child as food to the father; but the gods, in indignation, transformed
Procne into a swallow, Philomela into a nightingale, forever
bemoaning the murdered Itylus, and Tereus into a hawk, forever
pursuing the sisters."&mdash;GAYLEY'S <i>Classic Myths</i>.</p>

Arnold's love for animals, especially his household pets, was
most sincere. Despite the playful irony of his poem, there is in
the minor key an undertone of genuine sorrow. "We have just
lost our dear, dear mongrel, Kaiser," he wrote in a letter dated
from his home in Cobham, Kent, April 7, 1887, "and we are very
sad." The poem was written the following July, and was published

<h3><a href="#PAL">PALLADIUM</a><a name="PALLADIUM">°</a></h3>
<p>
At the time of the Trojan war there was in the citadel of Troy
a celebrated statue of Pallas Athene, called the Palladium. It was
reputed to have fallen from heaven as the gift of Zeus, and the
belief was that the city could not be taken so long as this statue
remained within it. Ulysses and Diomedes, two of the Greek
champions, succeeded in entering the city in disguise, stole the
Palladium and carried it off to the besiegers' camp at Argos. It
was some time, however, before the city fell.</p>
<p>
<b><a name="1p">1.</a> Simois.</b> A small river of the Troad which takes its rise in
the rocky, wooded eminence which, according to Greek tradition,
formed the acropolis of Troy. The Palladium was set up on its
banks near its source, in a temple especially erected for it (l. 6),
and from this lofty position was supposed to watch over the safety
of the city and her defenders on the plains below.</p>
<p>
<b><a name="3p">3.</a> Hector.</b> Hector, son of Priam, king of Troy (Ilium), and his
wife, Hecuba, was the leader and champion of the Trojan armies.
He distinguished himself in numerous single combats with the
ablest of the Greek heroes; and to him was principally due the
stubborn defence of the Trojan capital. He was finally slain by
Achilles, aided by Athene, and his body dragged thrice around
the walls of Troy behind the chariot of his conqueror.</p>
<p>
<b><a name="14p">14.</a> Xanthus.</b> The Scamander, the largest and most celebrated
river of the Troad, near which Troy was situated, was presided
over by a deity known to the gods as Xanthus. His contest with
Achilles, whom he so nearly overwhelmed, forms a notable incident
of the <i>Iliad</i>.</p>
<p>
<b><a name="15p">15.</a> Ajax, or Aiax.</b> One of the leading Greek heroes in the siege
of Troy, famous for his size, physical strength, and beauty. In
bravery and feats of valor he was second only to Achilles. Not
being awarded the armor of Achilles after that hero's death, he		 	 <span class="left">[p.190]</span>
slew himself.</p>
<p>
<b><a name="16p">16.</a></b> Helen, the wife of Menelaus, king of Sparta, was celebrated
for her beauty, by reason of which frequent references are made to
her by both classic and modern writers. Goethe introduces her in
the second part of <i>Faust</i>, and Faustus, in Marlowe's play of that
name, addresses her thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">
"Oh! thou art fairer than the evening air<br />
Clad in the beauty of a thousand stars."
</p>
<p>
Her abduction by Paris, son of Priam (see note, l. 3), was the
cause of the Trojan war, the most notable incident of Greek
mythology, which forms the theme of Homer's greatest poem,
the <i>Iliad</i>.</p>
<p>
What is the central thought of the poem? Of what is the Palladium
typical? Explain the thought in stanza 3. What is the

<h4>APRIL, 1850</h4>
<p>
Wordsworth died at Rydal Mount, in the Lake, District, April
23, 1850. These verses, dedicated to his memory, are among
Arnold's best-known lines. For adequacy of meaning and charm
of expression, they are almost unsurpassed; they also contain
some of the poet's soundest poetical criticism. The poem was
first published in <i>Fraser's Magazine</i> for June, 1850, and bore
the date of April 27.</p>
<p>
<b><a name="1m">1.</a> Goethe in Weimar sleeps.</b> The tomb of Goethe, the celebrated
German author (see note, l. <a href="#29el">29</a>, <i>Epilogue to Lessing's

Saxe-Weimar. Weimar is noted as the literary centre of Germany, and
for this reason is styled the German Athens.</p>
<p>
<b><a name="2m">2.</a> Byron.</b> George Gordon Byron (1788-1824), a celebrated English
poet of the French Revolutionary period, died at Missolonghi,
Greece, where he had gone to help the Greeks in their struggle to
throw off the Turkish yoke. He was preëminently a poet of passion,
and, as such, exerted a marked influence on the literature of
his day. His petulant, bitter rebellion against all law has become
proverbial; hence the term "Byronic." The <b>Titans</b> (l. 14) were
a race of giants who warred against the gods. The aptness of
the comparison made here is at once evident. In Arnold's sonnet,
<i>A Picture at Newstead</i>, also occur these lines:&mdash;</p>

serpent, and passed to the realm of the dead&mdash;Hades. Thither
Orpheus descended, and, by the charm of his lyre and song, persuaded
Pluto to restore her to life. This he consented to do on
condition that she walk behind her husband, who was not to look
at her until they had arrived in the upper world. Orpheus, however,
looked back, thus violating the conditions, and Eurydice was
caught back into the infernal regions.</p>

"There was very lately a lad in the University of Oxford who
was by his poverty forced to leave his studies there and at last to
join himself to a company of vagabond gipsies. Among these
extravagant people, by the insinuating subtilty of his carriage, he
quickly got so much of their love and esteem that they discovered
to him their mystery. After he had been a pretty while exercised
in the trade, there chanced to ride by a couple of scholars
who had formerly been of his acquaintance. They quickly spied
out their old friend among the gipsies, and he gave them an account
of the necessity which drove him to that kind of life, and
told them that the people he went with were not such impostors as
they were taken for, but that they had a traditional kind of learning
among them, and could do wonders by the power of imagination,
their fancy binding that of others; that himself had learned
much of their art, and when he had compassed the whole secret,		 <span class="left">[p.198]</span>

beautiful and graceful poem on the <i>Scholar-Gipsy</i> (the Oxford student
who is said to have forsaken academic study in order to learn,
if it might be, those potent secrets of nature, the traditions of
which the gypsies are supposed sedulously to guard) ends in a
digression of the most vivid beauty.... Nothing could illustrate
better than this [closing] passage Arnold's genius and his art....
His whole drift having been that care and effort and gain
and pressure of the world are sapping human strength, he ends
with a picture of the old-world pride and daring, which exhibits
human strength in its freshness and vigor.... I could quote
poem after poem which Arnold closes by some such buoyant
digression: a buoyant digression intended to shake off the tone of
melancholy, and to remind us that the world of imaginative life is
still wide open to us.... This problem is insoluble, he seems to
say, but insoluble or not, let us recall the pristine force of the<span class="left">[p.202]</span>
human spirit, and not forget that we have access to great resources
still.... Arnold, exquisite as his poetry is, teaches us first to
feel, and then to put by, the cloud of mortal destiny. But he does
not teach us, as Wordsworth does, to bear it."</p>

<h3><a href="#THYR">THYRSIS</a><a name="THYRSIS">°</a></h3>
<p>
A monody to commemorate the author's friend, Arthur Hugh
Clough, who died at Florence, 1861.</p>
<p>
Throughout this poem there is reference to the preceding selection,
<i>The Scholar-Gipsy</i>, of which it is the companion piece, and, in a
sense, the sequel. It is one of the four great elegies in the English
language.</p>
<p>
Thyrsis is a name common to both ancient and modern literature.
In the Idyls of Theocritus it is used as the name of a herdsman; in
the Eclogues of Vergil, of a shepherd; while in later writings it has
come to mean any rustic.</p>
<p>
Arthur Hugh Clough (1819-1861), whose poetry is closely akin
in spirit to Arnold's, was a young man of genius and promise. He
studied at both Rugby and Oxford, where he and Arnold were intimately
associated and became fast friends. In 1869 his health
began to fail, and two years later he died in Florence, Italy, where
he had gone in the hope of being benefited by the climate.</p>
<p>
Arnold, in a letter to his mother dated April, 1866, says of his
poem: "Tell dear old Edward [Arnold] that the diction of the
Thyrsis was modelled on that of Theocritus, whom I have been
much reading during the two years this poem has been forming
itself, and that I meant the diction to be so artless as to be almost
heedless. However, there is a mean which must not be passed,
and before I reprint this I will consider well all objections. The
images are all from actual observation.... The cuckoo in the
wet June morning, I heard in the garden at Woodford, and all<span class="left">[p.204]</span>
those three stanzas, which you like, are reminiscences of Woodford.
Edward has, I think, fixed on the two stanzas I myself like
best: 'O easy access,' and 'And long the way appears.' I also
like 'Where is the girl,' and the stanza before it; but that is because
they bring certain places and moments before me.... It
is probably too quiet a poem for the general taste, but I think it
will stand wear." To his friend, John Campbell Shairp, Arnold
wrote, a few days later: "Thyrsis is a very quiet poem, but, I
think, solid and sincere. It will not be popular, however. It had
long been in my head to connect Clough with that Cumner country,
and, when I began, I was carried irresistibly into this form. You
say, truly, that there was much in Clough (the whole prophetic
side, in fact) which one cannot deal with in this way.... Still,
Clough had the idyllic side, too; to deal with this suited my desire
to deal again with that Cumner country. Anyway, only so could
I treat the matter this time. <i>Valeat quantum</i>."</p>

Arnold's intense love for Oxford and the surrounding country appears in
many of his essays and poems. In the introduction to his <i>Essays
on Criticism</i>, Vol. I, occurs the following tribute: "Beautiful
city! so venerable, so lovely, so unravaged by the fierce intellectual
life of our century, so serene!</p>

<p class="indent">
'There are our young barbarians all at play!'
</p>
<p>
And yet, steeped in sentiment as she lies, spreading her garments
to the moonlight, and whispering from her towers the last enchantment
of the Middle Age, who will deny that Oxford, by her ineffable
charm, keeps ever calling us nearer the true goal of all of us, to the
ideal, to perfection&mdash;to beauty, in a word, which is only truth seen
from another side?... Home of lost causes and forsaken beliefs
and unpopular names and impossible loyalties! what example could
ever so inspire us to keep down the Philistine in ourselves, what
teacher could ever so save us from that bondage to which we are all
prone, that bondage which Goethe, in his incomparable lines on the
death of Schiller, makes it his friend's highest praise ... to have
left miles out of sight behind him: the bondage of 'was uns alle
bändigt, Das Gemeine'?"</p>

<p>
<b><a name="45th">38-45.</a> Needs must I lose them</b>, etc. That is, I must lose them,

to see men living so far below their privileges. This, with his loss

power of the king of Phrygia, Lityerses. Lityerses used to make
strangers try a contest with him in reaping corn, and to put them
to death if he overcame them. Hercules arrived in time to save
Daphnis, took upon himself the reaping contest with Lityerses,
overcame him, and slew him. The Lityerses-song connected with
this tradition was, like the Linus-song, one of the early, plaintive
strains of Greek popular poetry, and used to be sung by the corn
reapers. Other traditions represented Daphnis as beloved by a
nymph, who exacted from him an oath to love no one else. He
fell in love with a princess, and was struck blind by the jealous
nymph. Mercury, who was his father, raised him to heaven, and
made a fountain spring up in the place from which he ascended.

<h3><a href="#CHAPEL">RUGBY CHAPEL</a><a name="RUGBY">°</a></h3>
<p>
<i>Rugby Chapel</i> (1857), one of Arnold's best-known and most characteristic
productions, was written in memory of his father, Dr.
Thomas Arnold, famous as the great head-master at Rugby. Dr.
Arnold was born at East Cowes in the Isle of Wight, June 13,
1795, and as a boy was at school at Warminster and Winchester.
In 1811 he entered Corpus Christi College, Oxford, and having
won recognition as a scholar, was awarded a fellowship of the Oriel
in 1815. Three years later he settled at Laleham, where, in 1820,
he married Mary Penrose, daughter of Justice Penrose, and where,
two years later, was born Matthew, who was destined to win
marked distinction among English men of letters. In 1827 he was
elected head-master at Rugby, and shortly afterward began those
important reforms which have placed him among the greatest<span class="left">[p.210]</span>
educators of his century. Chief among his writings is his <i>History
of Rome</i>, published in several volumes. In 1841 he was appointed
Regius Professor of History at Oxford. He died very suddenly on
Sunday, June 12, 1842, and on the following Friday his remains
were interred in the chancel of Rugby Chapel, immediately under
the communion table.</p>
<p>
In his poem Arnold has drawn a vivid picture of a strong, helpful,
hopeful, unselfish soul, cheering and supporting his weaker
comrades in their upward and onward march&mdash;a picture of the
guide and companion of his earlier years; and in so doing he has
preserved his father's memory to posterity in a striking and an
abiding way.</p>
<p>
<b><a name="13rc">1-13.</a></b> Note carefully the tone of these introductory lines, and
determine the poet's purpose in opening the poem in this mood.
The picture inevitably calls to mind Bryant's lines, <i>The Death of
Flowers</i>.</p>
<p>
<b><a name="16rc">16.</a> gloom.</b> The key-word to the preceding lines. Explain why
it calls to mind the poet's father. Keats makes a similar use of the
word <i>forlorn</i> in his <i>Ode to the Nightingale</i>.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... forlorn.<br />
Forlorn! the very word is like a bell<br />
To toll me back from thee to my sole self."

<p>
<b><a name="37rc">37.</a> shore</b>. A word common to hymns.</p>
<p>
<b><a name="57rc">38-57.</a></b> Discuss the poet's idea of the future life as set forth in
these lines. Can you think of any other author or authors who have
held a like view?</p>
<p>
<b><a name="59rc">58-59.</a></b> The poet asks this question only to answer it in the lines
following. Compare and contrast the two classes of men spoken
of; their aims in life and their achievements. Why is the path of
those who have chosen a "clear-purposed goal" pictured so difficult?<span class="left">[p.211]</span>
Who are they that start well, but fall out by the wayside?</p>
<p>
<b><a name="93rc">90-93.</a></b> Compare with Byron's description of a storm in the Alps,
Canto III, <i>Childe Harold</i>.</p>

From peak to peak, the rattling crags among<br />
Leaps the live thunder."
</p>
<p>
<b><a name="100rc">98-101.</a></b> So unstable is the hold of the "snow-beds" on the
mountain sides that travellers passing beneath them are forbidden
by the guides to speak, lest their voices precipitate an avalanche.
See ll. 160-169, <i>Sohrab and Rustum</i>.</p>
<p>
<b><a name="123rc">117-123.</a></b> What human frailties are indicated in the answer to
the host's question? Note the contrast in the succeeding lines.</p>
<p>
<b><a name="144rc">124-144.</a></b> The imagery of these lines is drawn from Dr. Arnold's
life at Rugby. Under his care frequent excursions were made into
the neighboring Westmoreland Hills. Nothing perhaps gives a
better idea of the man than the description of his "delight in those
long mountain walks, when they would start with their provisions
for the day, himself the guide and life of the party, always on the
lookout how best to break the ascent by gentle stages, comforting
the little ones in their falls and helping forward those who were
tired, himself always keeping with the laggers, that none might
strain their strength by trying to be in front with him; and then,
when his assistance was not wanted, the liveliest of all&mdash;his step
so light, his eye so quick in finding flowers to take home to those
who were not of the party."&mdash;ARTHUR PENRHYN STANLEY.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
